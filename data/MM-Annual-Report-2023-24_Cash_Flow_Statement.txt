Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis from the date the control is transferred to the Group. Investment in associates and joint
ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost. These financial statements are prepared
by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group. Changes in the Group’s interest in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted as equity transactions. In case of loss of control
of a subsidiary, the gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. The fair value of any investment retained at the date when control is lost is regarded
as the cost on initial recognition of investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity or as the fair value on initial recognition of investment
classified as a financial asset, as the case may be.
(d) Measurement of fair values A number of Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and
liabilities. The Group has established policies and procedures with respect to the measurement of fair values.
