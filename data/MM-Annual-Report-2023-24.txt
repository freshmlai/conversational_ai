CHAIRMAN’S
MESSAGE

We are truly
Mahindra – Unlimited.
Dear Shareholders,
An oft-quoted line from Shakespeare says, “There
is a tide in the affairs of men / which when taken at
the flood, / leads on to fortune.” There are tides in
the affairs of nations and companies as well. It is
undoubtedly a good time to be an Indian company.
The interplay of geopolitics and economic linkages
in the post-COVID era has seen India's position
strengthen. A new multi-polar manufacturing world
is emerging, as nations and companies rush to
reconfigure their supply chains to be more resilient
and diversified. India has emerged as a key
beneficiary. India's emerging role as one of the
vital nodes in future-proofed supply chains across
industries opens the door for growth within India
and expansion beyond. Clearly, the tides of
opportunity are rising.
For private industry, particularly manufacturing,
this confluence of factors translates into an
excellent chance to be a serious player in this new,
multi-polar world. To continue the opening quote,
“…On such a full sea are we now afloat / and we
must take the current when it serves.” The question
is, are we ready to take this current? Do we have
the will, the grit, and the gumption to take the tide
at its flood? Domestically, the stars are in alignment.
India has been heavily investing in infrastructure
and logistics. India is the cheapest manufacturing
destination in the world. There is a good supply of
labour. The need for jobs for young people, our
demographic dividend, is high. Externally too,
conditions are working in our favour. It's time to
seize the day.

How can we, in private industry, ensure that we ride
this upsurging tide? In the spirit of “ask not what
your country can do for you; ask what you can do
for your country”, I would argue that the most
important thing industry can do at this critical
juncture is to increase private investment. Private
capital investment is the key to capitalising on this
opportunity. It's a key driver of growth, jobs, and
demand. After the economic reforms of the 1990s,
it rose from around 10% to around 27% of GDP.
However, from 2011-12 onwards, private
investment as a percentage of GDP has been
falling to a worrisome level. We need to remedy
that situation.
The problem is not one of resources—rather, it is
one of mindset. Particularly after COVID, Indian
companies have become increasingly risk averse,
sticking to the tried and true rather than blazing
new trails. To some extent, this is understandable.
But when opportunity beckons, when private
industry can make a significant difference, it is time
to set aside our fear of failure and take a leap of
faith and self-belief.
We, in the Mahindra Group, are ready to take the
current when it serves, but we also believe in
making our own favourable tides and currents. The
Mahindra Group has had an extremely successful
few years on the back of a slew of strong product
launches across our Auto Division and Farm
Division complimented by a turnaround in Mahindra
Finance and successful value creation within our
Growth Gems. The XUV 3XO has broken barriers
and created a new segment.

The Scorpio-N has proved to be a blockbuster. The
Oja tractor is a path-breaking product in the global
tractor industry and promises to make its own
tidal waves. On the back of this rising tide, we are
stepping up our investments. We have already
announced an investment of INR 37,000 Crores
across our Auto, Farm and Services businesses
(excluding Tech Mahindra) in F25, F26 and F27.
These investments will, to a large extent, go
towards building capacity, with a pipeline of 26
new models/facelifts in the next 5 years. Mahindra
Finance's loan book crossed the threshold of one
lakh crores, increasing by 24% over the previous
year. The valuation of our Growth Gems increased
over 4x in the last 4 years. The contribution of our
Services businesses (Mahindra Finance, Tech
Mahindra and growth gems) to M&M's net cash
generation was almost seven thousand crores
over the F22-F24 period.
The future is pregnant with potential. So, I find it
somewhat ironic that the law requires businesses
to use the suffix 'Ltd” (to convey limited liability,
of course). That is a correct description of our legal
position, but we in M&M do not see ourselves as
limited in any other fashion. We know that there
will always be challenges; there will always be ups
and downs. But we also know that our resilience is
unquestionable, our imagination is unfettered, and
our aspirations are unconstrained. We are truly
Mahindra – Unlimited.
Sincerely,

Anand G. Mahindra
Chairman

MD & CEO’S
MESSAGE

We are grateful for our
shareholders' trust in our
journey, a crucial part of
our 'infinity loop' of growth.

Dear Shareholders,
Former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, affectionately
referred to as the Missile Man of India, left an
enduring legacy on the world with his profound
wisdom. His memorable quote, "If you want to shine
like a sun, first burn like a sun," encapsulates the
essence of perseverance. Just as the sun persists
through clouded skies, India has stood resilient
amidst tumult, global conflicts, and economic
adversities. Mirroring the sun's resilience, India has
achieved an impressive growth rate of over 8% in
the past fiscal year.

Looking ahead, the horizon holds promising
opportunities. The Group is currently engaged in
7 out of 10 high-potential sectors that are propelling
India's economic growth. We are excited about
shaping the electric SUV category with sustainable
and sophisticated products that are designed to
delight customers. Our Farm business is positioned
well for international growth. Both Mahindra Finance
and Tech Mahindra will unlock their full potential.
And, our growth gems are targeting an additional
5x growth over the next 5-7 years.

Much like India's achievements, at the Mahindra
Group, we have consistently pursued innovation
to unlock new opportunities, represented by the
“infinity loop” on the cover of our annual report.
In F24, the Group achieved its highest-ever profit
with our businesses firing on all cylinders.

We recognise that private capital investment plays
a crucial role in maximising the opportunities in India.
By outlining a capex plan of INR 37,000 Crores for
the next three years, we remain committed to our
proven strategy of prudent capital allocation. The
Group draws confidence from the cash generation
across our businesses, our low debt levels, and a
robust balance sheet. Simultaneously, we are
committed to investing in 'Tech and Talent,' … these
are essential for innovation and nurturing a talented
workforce, positioning us as an employer of choice.

Reflecting on F24, the automotive business
sustained its growth trajectory and retained its
position as the #1 SUV player by revenue. Our Farm
business showed resilience in a year marked by a
monsoon shortfall, gaining 40bps market share in a
declining industry. Mahindra Finance made
significant progress in its turnaround plan, reducing
delinquencies to under 4%, increasing assets by
24% to over INR 1,00,000 Crores and revamping
processes leveraging technology and data. The
turnaround at Tech Mahindra has commenced, with
a sharp focus on growth and margins. Our Growth
Gems have enhanced valuation by 4x over the past
4 years to $4.2 billion.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to our North
Star, 'RISE'. Our credo of driving positive change in our
communities ensures that sustainability is integral to
our business operations, steering us towards a planetpositive future. We have achieved substantial progress
to make our operations greener across energy, water,
and waste. M&M's share of renewable energy
increased to 33% in F24. We have doubled the
energy efficiency of our operations since F09, and
now use half the energy to manufacture each vehicle.

M&M maintained its water positivity status and now
has over 85% 'zero waste to landfill' locations. Our
tree plantation program, Hariyali, has enriched the
landscape with nearly 25 million trees to date.
Recognising the immense potential of women in India,
we have taken significant steps towards inclusivity
and empowerment. A significant step that has set a
new industry benchmark is the introduction of a
visionary 5 year maternity policy aimed at creating a
more equitable and supportive work environment for
women. Furthermore, since inception through Nanhi
Kali, we have educated around 7,00,000 young girls
from disadvantaged homes and skilled around
7,70,000 women to enable them to become job
ready through our women's empowerment program.
Our actions are governed by robust corporate
governance standards that uphold integrity in all
facets of our operations, ensuring transparency and
accountability.
We are grateful for our shareholders' trust in our
journey, a crucial part of our 'infinity loop' of growth.
We recently surpassed the INR 3 trillion M-Cap level
on the bourses. M&M shares soared by over 66%
outpacing the nearly 25% appreciation seen in
broader market indices. Your belief in our vision and
active contribution to our progress are key in this
continuous cycle of success. Together, we can unlock
infinite possibilities, each one a precious gem waiting
to be discovered.
Warm regards,

Dr. Anish Shah
Managing Director and CEO

HOW TO READ THE REPORT

We embarked on our journey of Integrated
Reporting in F17 in keeping with our commitment
towards transparency and the highest standards of
corporate governance. The following year, to
present our shareholders with a more holistic view
of how we create and sustain long-term value, we
included key elements of the Integrated Report
(IR) along with the Annual Report. While staying
true to the principles of the International
Integrated Reporting Council's framework that was
incorporated in the past, our Integrated Report
structure has also evolved to create a more readerfriendly experience.

Integrated Report <IR>

Scope of the Report

Businesses exist to create value - not only for the
shareholders, but also for their diverse
stakeholders. A business's ability to sustain value
over the long-term depends on how it manages,
leverages, and integrates its tangible and intangible
resources - from financial capital, plant &
machinery, employees, communities, government
licenses and natural resources; to corporate
governance practices, intellectual knowhow and
the social license to operate.

The reporting period of Mahindra & Mahindra
Limited apropos this Integrated Report is
1 April, 2023 to 31 March, 2024.

An Integrated Report takes corporate reporting
beyond just discussing the financial resources,
since any value creation activity requires other
resources like people, natural resources and
business relationships. This report will discuss how
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (M&M Ltd.) creates value
by leveraging the interlinkages between these
interdependent resources. Where necessary, we
have explained the concept using charts and
infographics. Some IR related data might be
management estimates and could be updated in
subsequent publications, like the Mahindra
Sustainability Report.

For any other information please visit
www.mahindra.com

We use an easy-to-understand diagram to depict
inputs, outputs, and the resulting outcomes, with
respect to capital, that are measured by KPIs.
The structure of this report remains true to the
principles of integrated reporting and seeks to
create a more lucid flow of information for a crisp
and coherent disclosure. The detailed Statutory
Statements and Financial Reports are also part of
this document and are in line with the
requirements of the Companies Act, 2013
(including the Rules made thereunder), Indian
Accounting Standards, Securities and Exchange
Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and the
applicable Secretarial Standards.
Please note that certain statements in this report
with regard to our future growth prospects are
forward-looking statements, which involve a
number of risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those in
such forward-looking statements.
Throughout the report, the terms 'Mahindra',
'Mahindra & Mahindra', 'M&M', and 'M&M Ltd.' have
been used interchangeably to refer to Mahindra &
Mahindra Limited.

This Integrated Report provides an overview
of the operations and business development
activities of the Company. It is also aligned to
the nine principles of the National Voluntary
Guidelines on Social, Environmental and
Economic Responsibilities of Business released
by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
The scope of this Report is related to Mahindra &
Mahindra Limited, consisting of the Automotive
Sector, Farm Equipment Sector, Spares Business
Unit, Mahindra Research Valley, Two-Wheeler
Division, Construction Equipment Division and
Powertrain Business Division.
We have represented data related to other group
businesses and Companies, wherever required, to
provide a holistic view of the Company's
performance and presence.
This Integrated Report
provides a cohesive view of
our performance and ability
to create value consistently
through six capitals – Financial,
Manufactured, Intellectual,
Human, Social & Relationship,
and Natural.

OVERVIEW

COMPANY
OVERVIEW
MAHINDRA &
MAHINDRA LTD.

THE MAHINDRA
GROUP
The Mahindra Group began its journey eight decades
ago in steel trading. Today, it is a large multi-industry
conglomerate with a leading position in many
sectors in India. The Company is broadly organised
into three major segments: Auto, Farm and Services.
As a leading player in India's auto industry, Mahindra
is known for its authentic SUVs and rugged light
commercial vehicles. The Group is rapidly moving
towards an electrified future with its leadership in
EV three-wheelers and upcoming EV SUV launches.
In the Farm segment, Mahindra is the leader in
tractors and is quickly emerging as a significant
force in farm machinery. What is remarkable is the
rapid growth of the Services segment, which
includes a diverse range of businesses such as
financial services, hospitality, information technology,
and residential and commercial real estate.
The Group has a strong focus on purpose, believing
in its crucial role in leading ESG initiatives globally,
promoting diversity, and setting benchmarks in
governance. The Mahindra Group has been a pioneer
in all these areas. Central to this focus is the Group's
philosophy of RISE, which is about positively
impacting the communities it touches.
The future of the Mahindra Group will be driven by
its focus on delivering scale in each of its businesses.
The Group believes this is a pivotal moment in the
nation's history, and it is well-positioned to be a
brand of choice both in India and globally.

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. is the flagship Company of
the Mahindra Group. Our core business is mobility
products and farm solutions. Since assembling our
first vehicle in 1947, we have grown rapidly. Today,
we offer a wide range of products and solutions
ranging from SUVs, pickups, commercial vehicles and
tractors, to electric vehicles, two-wheelers, gensets
and construction equipment.

due to a slowdown in some key markets like the U.S.,
Sri Lanka, etc. In Q4 of F24, we launched the new
Mahindra OJA in the U.S. market, the second largest
market for Mahindra outside India. Going forward,
we will launch the Mahindra Tractor brand in new
markets such as Europe and ASEAN for faster
growth of overall exports.

AUTOMOTIVE
SECTOR

FARM EQUIPMENT
SECTOR

While the long-term outlook for the Indian Auto
Industry is promising, the industry took four years
to pre-COVID levels in commercial vehicles, threewheelers and two-wheelers. Passenger vehicles
which had already recovered to reach pre-COVID
levels last year, crossed the 4.2 millionth mark in
F24.

The mid to long term outlook for the Indian tractor
industry is positive. The industry is seeing an
upswing with harvesting of crops underway and
expectations of a bumper crop this Rabi season.
Acreage of summer crop which is sown between
Rabi and Kharif season has crossed last year's level
which is also promising for the farmer community.

Factors that may significantly influence demand for
automobiles in F25 are:

Government budgets on infrastructure and rural
development are likely to benefit commercial
demand. Further, the demand for mechanisation is
also growing as shortage of agricultural labour will
lead to increase in labour cost.

Ÿ Policies by the Government to boost
consumption.

Ÿ Aggressive Government push for infrastructureled growth.

Ÿ Increase in cost of ownership due to commodity
price and fuel price increase.

As per the Automotive
Mission Plan 2026 (AMP
2026), the mid to longterm outlook for the
Indian auto industry is
positive.

Ÿ In partnership with our key suppliers, we are
leveraging digitisation to insulate our operations
from supply chain volatility.

In addition, there are risks like significant variations in
monsoon and supply chain blockages prompted by
the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and crisis in the
Middle East that we will continue to address.

Efﬁciency

AS, Nashik

AS, Nashik

In the automobile manufacturing sector, energy
consumption primarily stems from motors and
blowers, constituting almost 60% of a unit's energy
usage. Among these, blowers, including Air Handling
Units (AHUs) and Air Circulators, contribute over
40%. AHUs are indispensable for maintaining a
healthy environment for operators, so they can
neither be completely removed or even reduced in
numbers.

In the automotive industry, the paint shop stands
out as an energy guzzler and within this process,
significant energy is consumed in heating pretreatment chemicals and baking Cathodic Electrodeposition (CED) paint coatings.

To tackle this, the AS team explored replacing
conventional AHUs and Air Circulators with energyefficient alternatives. They identified two key
interventions:

Ÿ Replacement of Conventional AHUs with
intelligent EC Blowers

Ÿ Replacement of Conventional Air Circulators with
BLDC and HVLS fans
The implementation of intelligent EC Blowers at 7
plants of M&M resulted in energy savings of more
than 50%. Similarly, BLDC Air Circulators,
implemented at 9 plants, provided better airflow
using less energy, resulting in more than 35%
savings in energy cost.
These interventions collectively led to significant
benefits:

AS, Nashik faced the challenge of seamlessly
integrating new energy-efficient technology
solutions in its 26-year-old pre-treatment and
CED processes without compromising quality or
productivity.
Utilising the Project Evaluation Review Technique
(PERT), the Unit meticulously analysed energy and
material consumption trends. Collaborating with a
leading surface treatment technology supplier, it
identified two innovative products.

Ÿ Gardoclean VP 42928 LB for degreasing
Ÿ Cathoguard CG800 for CED coating.
With Gardoclean VP 42928 LB, the degreasing stage
operating temperature reduced to 40°C from
existing 55-60°C. While with CED CG 800 – CED,
material consumption could be reduced by 0.8kg per
bodyshell.
The project has led to significant annual saving of
INR 35 lakh from reduced energy usage and INR
2.17 crore from material savings (fuel, water, and
power). To cascade the deployment of green
technology products, learnings from the AS, Nashik
project are being shared with the Chakan plant for
horizontal deployment.

The AS, Nashik Paint
shop is the 1st OEM in
India to implement this
technology at 40°C.

natural, social, and financial, and any gap between
demand and supply of water has major
repercussions.
Extreme weather events are making water
scarcer.
At Mahindra, we follow a holistic water conservation
approach to balance the water requirement of
operations and the community. This includes
optimising consumption, recycling at scale, plus
capturing and recapturing to rejuvenate the water
sources.

In F24, M&M's groundwater recharge increased by
16%, and we reused 35% of treated water across
the Group. Notably, Igatpuri Plant operated 243 days
without external water. At the Group level, Mahindra
Susten's eight locations are TUV-certified as water
positive. Mahindra Lifespaces saves 10.65 million
litres annually by substituting traditional concrete

PERFORMANCE
MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM
Once the capacities have been built, they need to be
monitored and managed for scaled up outcomes. To
continually encourage outperformance, our
Performance Management System is built on strong
principles of empowerment and meritocracy.
Leaders foster an environment that encourages
employees to demonstrate the right behaviour and
deliver outstanding results.
To better the performance of individuals at every
stage across the performance cycle from 1 April
to 31 March, a three-step process of Goal Setting,
Mid-Year Review and Annual Appraisal offers
feedback by People Managers. Key decisions are
based on Performance and Leadership Behaviour
Scores and discussions amongst the talent panels
at different levels. Learning & Growth Plan serves as
a great tool for future roles, skill development and
career growth of existing employees.

The Performance
Management System
drives the three key
Mahindra Leadership
Behaviours: Collaboration,
Agility, and Boldness

DIVERSITY,
EQUITY AND
INCLUSION
At Mahindra, Diversity & Inclusion drive our
commitment to a brighter future, eliminating gender
and disability bias in employment and advancement.
We monitor diversity metrics closely, ensuring
representation in leadership and talent programmes.
Our Group Diversity Council employs a metricsdriven scorecard, particularly emphasising gender
diversity. Through our Equal Opportunity Policy,
recruits receive comprehensive training, including
the 'Speak Up' campaign for POSH awareness and
refresher modules from Ethics Counsellors,
empowering them to excel in their roles and
contribute to a culture of inclusion.

Across our CSR initiatives, we place a special
focus on empowering girls and women with
equal opportunities which not only benefits
them individually but has a ripple effect on their
communities and the environment.
When girls and women have access to education,
employment, and decision-making roles, there is
a huge social impact and value created for
society over the long term. At Mahindra, our pillar
of Rise for a More Equal World is characterised
by our CSR initiatives of providing equal
opportunities to girls and women and showing
compassion towards the environment.

In F24, we elevated our social impact with an

EMPOWERING
WOMEN
India's women are the co-authors of its economic growth story. Addressing the concerning decline in the female
labour force participation rate has thus become a top national priority. The Mahindra Group aims to play a
pivotal role in empowering women economically by offering vital skills training and creating job opportunities
across various sectors. The women experienced different skilling interventions, as detailed below:

AGRI SKILLING
EMPLOYABILITY SKILLING
The Group's flagship employability skills program,
Mahindra Pride Classrooms (MPC), was launched as a
youth skilling initiative inclusive of boys and has now
evolved into an all-women program to support the
nation's priority of increasing women's labour force
participation in the formal economy. Since its
inception, the Program has empowered 8,98,846
youth with employability skills.
Mahindra Pride Classrooms offer 40-120 hour
training modules led by expert trainers for final-year
female students in Government and Governmentaided Colleges, ITIs, and Polytechnic Institutes across
India. The modules include digital literacy and life
skills that aim to make the candidates more “jobready” and employable. Assessments are a key part
of the program design and successful candidates are
provided with certification at the end of the course.
In F24, the Mahindra Group supported 1,70,038
women studying in 1,711 colleges. Of these,
1,29,227 women were trained with support provided
by M&M. An additional 9,824 women underwent
employability skills training through another project
under this initiative with support provided by M&M.
DOMAIN SKILLING

Since its inception,
the women's empowerment
programme at Mahindra
Group has positively
influenced

7,65,107
women

IN F24 alone,
the Mahindra Group
supported the skilling of

2,28,540
women

In response to the evolving needs of the workforce,
our women's empowerment program also focuses
on equipping women with domain-specific skills
tailored to the automotive, IT, ITES/hospitality,
healthcare, and apparel industries across 15 states.
Through a comprehensive curriculum, participating
women gain in-depth knowledge of industry
practices, regulations, and technological
advancements relevant to these sectors. Under this
initiative, the Mahindra Group trained 17,550
women for domain skills. Of these 16,536 women
were trained by M&M.

Regenerative Agriculture
The main objective of the Project was to enable
women farmers to use regenerative agriculture
practices to improve soil fertility and increase crop
productivity, ensuring food and nutrition security
for their families, along with enhanced income
levels. Through this Project, 25,046 women farmers
from Moga and Tarn Taran in Punjab, Shravasti in
UP and Wardha in Maharashtra were provided
knowledge in regenerative farming practices. This
intervention helped women farmers reduce their
agriculture input costs and increase income from
the sale of crops.
Through this Project,

25,046

women farmers were provided
knowledge in regenerative
farming practices.

Farm Skilling
Under the farm skilling initiative of PRERNA, M&M
focuses on women farmers with an objective of
providing exposure to good agricultural and farm
mechanisation practices to augment their farmbased livelihood which include training and advisory
services like soil health, access to gender-friendly
farm equipment, linkages to Government welfare
support initiatives, and resource-efficient agriculture
methodologies for enhancing crop productivity.
6,082 women farmers were supported under this
farm-based skilling initiative in F24.

PROJECT HARIYALI
This flagship afforestation initiative of the Group
continues to enrich greenery and restore ecological
balance. It uplifts marginalised farmers through
training in modern farming techniques, revitalising
soil, improving water retention, and boosting soil
organic carbon levels.

In F24, the Mahindra Group planted a total of
2.27 million trees of which Mahindra & Mahindra
planted 1.8 million trees. As a result of this project,
the livelihoods of 4,545 tribal farmer families were
enhanced. 19 varieties of fruit, forest and shade
trees were planted, further contributing to
biodiversity, and improving the quality of soil and
crops.

In addition to our primary CSR initiatives, employee
volunteering plays a significant role in our
commitment to making a difference and empowering
others on a large scale. Through platforms like
ESOPs and MySeva, Mahindra Group employees
dedicate their time to various social causes, creating
substantial impact within communities.

 or details refer to ‘Statement of Changes in Equity’ in the Standalone Financial Statements and

‘Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity’ in the Consolidated Financial Statements respectively
forming part of the Annual Report.

Financial Year 2024 witnessed demand resilience regardless
of tightening financial conditions, simmering geo-political
risks and adverse weather patterns.
For instance, the US Federal Reserve increased policy rates
to the highest level in over two decades, but elevated
Government spending supported tight labour market
conditions. Hot wars near the Black Sea, the Red Sea and the
Gaza strip pushed up trading costs, however this came against
a backdrop of low input cost pressures brought about by
improving supply chain conditions and expectations of weak
global growth. Finally, El Nino conditions led to deficient rains
in India impacting rural incomes which were partly offset by
stronger construction activity. In this midst, aggressive output
curbs announced by OPEC pushed up crude oil prices close
to USD 100/bbl during the year; fortunately, higher supply
from the Americas brought temporary respite to fuel costs.
As a result of countervailing factors, demand momentum and
consumer sentiment were stronger than expected resulting
in central banks tightening financing conditions even further
and pushing policy rate cut expectations deeper into Financial
Year 2025.
In India, the growth push came from stronger services
exports, leveraged consumption from wealthier households
and public infrastructure capex. India’s real GDP grew at over
8% during the last three quarters of Calendar Year 2023.
The ongoing revival in private sector project announcements
portends sustained momentum in job creation going into
Financial Year 2025.
The Profit for the year before Depreciation, Finance Costs,
Exceptional items and Taxation recorded an increase of
31.36% at Rs. 17,060.59 crores as against Rs. 12,987.56
crores in the previous year. Profit after tax increased by
63.66% at Rs. 10,717.80 crores as against Rs. 6,548.64
crores in the previous year.
Your Company remains committed to its extensive cost
restructuring initiatives and efficiency enhancements, yielding
substantial savings. By maintaining a sharp focus on cost
controls, streamlining processes, and introducing innovative
products that consistently surpass customer expectations,
your Company sustains profitable growth despite the current
economic conditions.

deeper into Financial Year 2025. Fortunately, improvement
in supply chain conditions has lowered input cost pressures
providing households some respite against rising cost of living.

of monetary easing, robust profitability of large corporates
and the anticipated productivity gains related to artificial
intelligence. With Russia on sanctions, war in Middle East and
production cuts by OPEC+, Crude prices remained volatile.

In India, El Nino conditions have disrupted agricultural
output, but lower input costs and higher construction
activity is supporting rural income growth. The growth
push in Financial Year 2024 came from services exports,
leveraged consumption by wealthier households and public
sector infrastructure spending. Continuation of leveraged
consumption and an uptick in investments should support
growth in Financial Year 2025, even as expectations of above
normal monsoons improve agricultural incomes and lower
inflation. The economy is benefiting from revival in corporate
sector project announcements and improving consumer
sentiment, which augurs well for job generation in Financial
Year 2025. From the supply side, sustained improvement in
growth is likely post general elections in India, led by financial
services, manufacturing, and construction sectors.

India seized global spotlight, emerging as the fastest
growing major economy of the world in 2023-24 coupled
with navigating diplomatic challenges with finesse. India’s
economic activity exhibited resilience with GDP growth for
FY 2023-24 pegged at 7.6%, buoyed by strong domestic
demand and backed by robust macroeconomic fundamentals.

Finance
Financial Year 2023-24 saw global geopolitics reaching a pivotal
moment, with the tensions affecting international relations
on every continent. The global economic recovery proved
surprisingly resilient - inflation receded significantly in most
major economies, recession was mostly avoided, supply chain
disruption eased considerably, and labour markets remained
historically tight. Global growth rose by an estimated 3.2% in
2023, up from 2.3% in 2022, largely due to resilience in the
United States and several large emerging markets, coupled
with more fiscal support in China. The International Monetary
Fund (“IMF”) forecasts the world economy to continue growing
at 3.2% during 2024 and 2025, as well.
Decisive monetary policy actions by central banks around
the world led to sharp disinflation process. Headline inflation
fell to 6.8% in 2023 from a peak of 9.4% in 2022 and is set
to fall further in 2024. However, the path of future rate cuts
is not yet clear as commodity price spikes stemming from
geopolitical tensions, including those from the war in Ukraine
and the conflict in Middle East could, along with persistent
core inflation, raise interest rate expectations. Financial
market expectations of US policy rate reductions this year
have been pared back significantly.
The US dollar (DXY) remained strong in the wake of resilient
economic growth and hawkish Fed policy commentary. Global
equity markets ended the financial year on a high with
strongest performance since 2019, led by a bull run in major
markets such as the US, India and Japan on the prospect

The upturn in the investment cycle, broad-based revival in
manufacturing and services sectors and Government’s capex
push aided growth. Consumer price inflation (CPI) dropped
to 5.4% from 6.7% in previous year on account of base
effect, normal monsoon and supply side interventions. The
RBI Monetary Policy Committee kept the policy repo rate
unchanged at 6.5% since its last rate hike in February
2023. Bank credit growth remained robust with improving
economic activity, increasing by 16.3% (y-o-y) as at March
2024. Corporate Borrowing Costs generally hardened, amidst
tightening of liquidity conditions.
The Indian Rupee largely remained rangebound, depreciating
by 1.4% during the year, due to strong macroeconomic
fundamentals and improvements in India’s external position
with the moderation in the current account deficit (CAD),
revival of capital flows, and rising foreign exchange reserves.
India’s foreign exchange reserves hit a record high of
US$ 645.6 billion on 29th March, 2024. Net FPI inflows at
US$ 41.6 billion in 2023-24 were the highest since 2015-16.

D.	INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS
The Corporate Governance Policies guide the conduct
of affairs of your Company and clearly delineate the
roles, responsibilities and authorities at each level of its
Governance Structure and Key Functionaries involved in
Governance. The Code of Conduct for Senior Management
and Employees of your Company (the Code of Conduct)
commits Management to financial and accounting policies,
systems and processes. The Corporate Governance Policies
and the Code of Conduct stand widely communicated across
your Company at all times.
Your Company’s Financial Statements are prepared on the
basis of the Significant Accounting Policies that are carefully
selected by Management and approved by the Audit
Committee and the Board. These Accounting policies are
reviewed and updated from time to time.
Your Company uses SAP ERP Systems as a business enabler
and to maintain its Books of Account. The transactional
controls built into the SAP ERP Systems ensure appropriate
segregation of duties, appropriate level of approval
mechanisms and maintenance of supporting records. The
Policies related to the Information Management reinforce
the control environment. The systems, Standard Operating
Procedures and controls are reviewed by Management.
These systems and controls are subjected to Internal Audit
and their findings and recommendations are reviewed by the
Audit Committee which ensures the implementation.
Your Company has in place adequate internal financial controls
with reference to the Financial Statements commensurate
with the size, scale and complexity of its operations. Your
Company’s Internal Financial Controls were deployed through
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), that addresses material risks in your
Company’s operations and financial reporting objectives.
Such controls have been assessed during the year under
review taking into consideration the essential components
of internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Based on the
results of such assessments carried out by the Management, no
reportable material weakness or significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal financial controls were observed.

Your Company recognizes that the Internal Financial Controls
cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial,
operational and compliance reporting objectives because of
its inherent limitations. Also, projections of any evaluation of
the Internal Financial Controls to future periods are subject
to the risk that the Internal Financial Controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Accordingly, regular audits and review processes
ensure that such systems are reinforced on an ongoing basis.
In response to a cyber-attack on 16th March, 2024, the

The shortage of semiconductors post-COVID-19 was eased with
normalised global supply last year, while the increase in demand was
influenced by higher disposable income, credit availability, new
launches and minor impact due to regulations.
The Indian auto industry recognizes the importance of reducing
dependence on imported oil, enhancing road safety and most
importantly, ensuring clean air. Over the years, the industry has made
significant investments in indigenisation of technologies in the
conventional vehicles space e.g. meeting BS-VI in 3 years. In FY 202223, the industry has implemented BS6.2 emission norms in India. The
Government has notified Electric vehicle technology and Hydrogen
fuel cell technology as advanced automotive technology under PLI
(Production Linked Incentive) scheme and has approved E-Vehicle
policy to promote India as a manufacturing destination for
e-vehicles. This will provide Indian consumers with access to latest
technology, boost the Make in India initiative, strengthen the EV
ecosystem by promoting healthy competition amongst EV players
leading to high production volumes, economies of scale, lower
production cost , a reduction in our crude oil imports, and hence
lower trade deficit and positive impact on environment.

TRACTOR INDUSTRY
The long-term growth outlook for the Indian tractor industry
remains positive. Over the period FY 2008-09 to FY 2023-24, the
domestic tractor industry grew at a CAGR of 7.3%. The key growth
drivers were increasing affordability, growing demand for farm
mechanization, emergence of newer technologies in the farming
sector and continued Government's focus on improving the state of
agriculture in India.

TRACTOR INDUSTRY IN FY 2023-24
Indian tractor industry with an annual sale of 8.76 lakh unit in FY24,
saw a decline of around 7.4% compared to FY 2022-23. Exports out
of India dropped by 21.5% YoY and can be partly attributed to macroeconomic challenges in global environment.

In FY 2023-24, the Indian tractor industry was impacted by erratic
monsoon distribution both spatially and temporally. Farm output in
both kharif and rabi season was affected by one of the strongest El
Nino seen in the last 20 years. Prolonged dry weather also led to
excess irrigation usage, thereby escalating farm input cost. This put
pressure on the prof it margin of farmers. Limited period of
restrictions on export of food items like certain kinds of rice and
onions to arrest domestic inflation, further hit farm incomes. Overall
agriculture GVA showed muted growth at 1.4% in FY 2023-24
compared to 4.7% growth seen in previous year. Further,
Government spending on rural and agriculture also remained muted.
In FY 2023-24, employment generated under MGNREGA for
households fell short of demand by 34 million.
Your Company's market share in the domestic tractor industry stood
at 41.6% in FY 2023-24.

of farm productivity and farm labour shortage. Your Company has
aggressive plans to grow its Farm Machinery business, through
launch of 'Made in India' farm machinery products. These include
rotavators, harvesters and rice transplanters amongst others.
During the year, Mahindra Farm Machinery clocked the highest
ever revenue with a YoY 32% growth. This growth was driven by
record performance in rotavators where your Company is in 2nd

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

TWO-WHEELER SEGMENT
In line with the strategy for the two-wheeler business, your Company
through its subsidiary, Classic Legends Private Limited had
re-introduced the iconic brands 'Jawa' and 'Yezdi' to the Indian
market in the Financial Year 2019 and 2022 respectively. During
Financial Year 2022-23, 42 Bobber was introduced and during
Financial Year 2023-24, Jawa 350 was introduced to the Indian
market. In addition, the Company forayed into new international
markets through iconic British brand BSA in UK and European
market.

The Government of India (GoI) has approved E-Vehicle policy to
promote India as a manufacturing destination so that e-vehicles with
the latest technology can be manufactured in the country. Last year,
the GoI introduced Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for
Automobile, Auto components, ACC (Advanced Chemistry Cells) and
semiconductors to overcome the cost disabilities of the industry for
manufacture of Advanced Automotive Technology products in India.
The GoI has recognised Electric Vehicle technology and Hydrogen
fuel cell technology as an Advanced Automotive Technology in the
country.

In FY 2023-24, every
second passenger
vehicle sold was a
utility vehicle.
Milestone of 1 million
annual UV sales was
crossed in F20 and it
took just 4 years to
cross 2.5 million
annual sales mark.

158

Your Company is a pioneer of Electric Vehicles in India and is actively
pursuing development of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market, products
and technology. Along with Electrification, your Company is also
working on alternate fuels technology.

FARM EQUIPMENT SECTOR
Robust government support has spurred uptake in farm
mechanisation and contemporary farming techniques, alongside
broader rural development efforts.

The volumes for Financial Year 2023-24 were impacted with delays
in launching improved products and subdued marketing spends in
the Domestic market. Export volumes fell owing to slowdown in the
UK/European economies and the Russia-Ukraine conflicts, impacting
demand sentiments. However, with funding tied-up for the next level
of growth and new external investors coming on board, focus for
FY 2024-25 will be on Product improvements, Dealer developments,
Network expansion, Cost reductions and to grow the volumes multifold in FY 2024-25 and ahead.

OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS

India which has a substantial base of small and marginal farmers,
grapple with numerous areas characterized by limited penetration of
farm mechanisation. As labor scarcity persists, escalating labor
costs, widespread adoption of diverse mechanization methods
emerge as the way forward. Considering these circumstances, the
trajectory of the tractor and farm machinery market is anticipated to
exhibit long-term growth.

ALLIED BUSINESSES
The rising demand for power backup solutions and infrastructure
development will create opportunities in the power generation and
infrastructure equipment space. This is an opportunity for the
Company to grow its offerings in power solutions and construction
equipment.

In Financial Year 2023-24, Passenger vehicles have reached a new,
highest-ever mark with 4.2 million sales units while commercial
vehicles have shown flat growth of 0.6%. 3W reported growth of
41.5% with 0.7 million sales in FY 2023-24 vs 0.5 million sales in FY
2022-23. The shortage of semiconductors post-COVID-19 was
eased with normalised global supply in the last year, while the
increase in demand was influenced by higher disposable income,
credit availability, new launches and minor impact due to regulations.
To reduce the dependence on oil imports, the industry is exploring
options of alternate fuels like CNG, LNG, Ethanol, etc. The industry is
also exploring options of flex fuel vehicles in nearby future. The
industry is also investing in next generation technologies like
Electric Vehicles and hydrogen.

With the aim to remain competitive in the market and sustain its
leadership position, your Company continues to invest in new
product development, technology upgradations, increasing channel
reach, while focussing on delivering customer centric products,
services and brand building.

TAX REGULATIONS
India has traditionally seen a tax rate differential between small and
large passenger vehicles. This differential is based on length of the
vehicle, engine size and fuel type. While the flagship products of your
Company attract higher tax rates, your Company has strengthened
the UV product portfolio attracting lower tax rates with products
like XUV300, Bolero Neo, Bolero Power Plus and Thar. XUV400
attracts minimum GST amongst all passenger vehicle categories.

NEW REGULATION FOR SAFETY

RISKS AND CONCERNS

AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
Indian automotive industry has been christened as sunrise sector
and champion industry, due to the immense contribution the
industry makes to the Indian economy. Automotive industry turnover
is 6.5% of India's GDP and more than 40% of manufacturing GDP.

LCV Goods < 3.5T continue to dominate Commercial Vehicle sales
with a share of 47.6%.

AUTOMOTIVE AND
FARM EQUIPMENT SECTORS
The Company's business is exposed to many internal and external
risks and it has consequently put in place robust systems and
processes, along with appropriate review mechanisms to actively
monitor, manage and mitigate these risks.

COMPETITIVE INTENSITY
Given the high growth potential of the Indian automotive market, all
OEMs, homegrown as well as MNCs, have a presence across all vehicle
segments in India. Today, multinational OEMs are deeply entrenched
in the Indian market with local development centres, a strong local
supplier base and good channel penetration. In the PV segment, the
differentiation between cars and UVs is largely blurred. The industry
has seen a shift in demand from cars to UVs. This resulted in a greater
number of launches in UVs compared to cars.

Concerns over road safety are driving legislation and regulatory
reforms. Any new legislation requires technology development and
incurring of costs, in turn impacting vehicle prices. Your Company is
geared up and is conf ident of meeting any new regulations
introduced.

NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES
Your company has a comprehensive programme for development of
new products and technologies which will enable it to remain
competitive in the market, cater to emerging customer expectations
and to meet any legislative requirements. Along with Electrification,
your Company is also working on alternate fuels technology.

ENVIRONMENT AND ALTERNATE FUELS
With concerns over air quality and the need to reduce dependence
on fossil fuels, the Government is actively pursuing large scale
adoption of EVs, especially for intracity uses in fleet application.

COMMODITY PRICES
The Commodity prices in the FY 2023-24 were moderate for most
part of the year compared to the previous year, on account of lower
global manufacturing activity and weak economic outlook, due to
elevated policy interest rates in the major world economies. Your
Company stayed focused on cost reduction through measures like
Value Addition (VA) / Value Engineering (VE), negotiation with
suppliers, long term price contracting, etc.
Your Company continues to watch the market situation closely and
continues to focus on mitigating commodity price volatility through
"Commodity Risk Management".
Hedging of currencies and commodities is being governed in
accordance with the Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy and
Commodity Risk Management Policy approved by the Board of
Directors of your Company.

CAPACITY
Through sustained efforts over the year, your Company has
enhanced monthly capacities of SUVs by 25%. We anticipate
producing 2,00,000 EVs between 2027 and 2029 from our cutting
edge Born Electric range. Furthermore, our investment proposal of
Rs. 10,000 Crores for electric vehicles was also approved under the
Industrial Promotion Scheme of Government of Maharashtra for
Electric Vehicles. Pursuant to our announcement of the Rs. 1,000
crores investment in Last Mile Mobility (LMM) business, we organised
a ground-breaking ceremony for a new manufacturing unit. With this
new facility, we aim to build state-of-the-art battery assembly line,

159

producing power packs and manufacture electronic as well as
drivetrain components for electric 3-wheelers and 4-wheelers.
We expect these steps in augmenting capacity to cater to the robust
demand growth in domestic and international markets. In
partnership with our key suppliers, we are leveraging digitisation to
insulate our operations from supply chain volatility.

MONSOON
A normal monsoon is important for both agriculture as well as the
rural economy at large. The tractor business in particular and the
automotive business to some degree, run the risk of a drop in
demand, in case of a significant variation in the monsoon. In addition,
an untimely monsoon and uneven spread has the potential of
adversely impacting the business.

MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in its long range
forecast, predicted seasonal rainfall (June to September, 2024)
to be 'Above Normal' i.e., at 106% of the Long Period Average
(LPA). Skymet's prediction was slightly lower at 102% of LPA. La
Nina conditions are expected to develop in the later half of
monsoon season.
The spatial distribution suggests that above-normal seasonal
rainfall is very likely over most parts of the country except some
areas over East and Northeast India, where below-normal rainfall
is likely.
Early onset of monsoon and IMD's affirmation of above-normal
rainfall is expected to boost rural sentiments.

ONGOING REGIONAL CONFLICTS
Indian industry could have issues related to lower supplies of
components due to supply chain blockages prompted by the ongoing
Russia-Ukraine war and crisis in the Middle East. This could lead to a
rise in domestic fuel prices.

OUTLOOK - AUTOMOTIVE
AND FARM SECTORS
Both the Automotive and Farm Sectors strive to sustain profitable
growth, maintain leadership position in the domestic market and
at the same time, explore global opportunities for growth.
Simultaneously, your Company continues its focus on achieving cost
leadership through focussed cost optimisation, productivity
improvements, value engineering, supply chain management, and
exploiting synergies between various group businesses.

AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS

As per the Automotive Mission
Plan 2026 (AMP 2026), the mid
to long-term outlook for the
Indian auto industry is positive.
Hon'ble Prime Minister unveiled
Indian Auto Industry Vision @
2047 mentioning Auto Industry is
the engine of economic growth.

While the long-term outlook for the Indian Auto Industry is promising,
the industry took four years to pre-COVID levels in commercial
vehicles, three-wheelers and two-wheelers. Passenger vehicles
which had already recovered to pre-COVID levels last year, crossed
the 4.2 million mark in FY 2023-24.

Factors that will significantly impact demand for automobiles in
FY 2024-25 are:

Policies by the Government to boost
consumption.

Aggressive Government push for
infrastructure-led growth.

Increase in cost of ownership due to
increase in commodity and fuel prices.

TRACTOR AND FARM
EQUIPMENT BUSINESS
The mid to long term outlook for the Indian tractor industry is
positive. The industry is expected to see an upswing this year with
the expectations of above normal monsoon. Positivity in farm
sentiments were evident with higher summer acreage recorded this
year. Also, the hike in MSP by 6% YoY will further incentivise farmers.
Kharif sowing is expected to begin on time, which is likely to boost
tractor demand in the coming months.

160

The Government budget on infrastructure and rural development
is likely to benefit commercial demand. Further, the demand for
mechanisation is also growing on account of likely increase in labour
cost owing to a shortage of agricultural labour. Several enabling
factors supporting industry growth like increasing cropping
intensity, diversification, institutional credit, consolidation of farm
holdings by FPOs, etc. have shown a positive trend in the last few
years. Increase in leasing of land from 10% in early 2000s to 17% in
FY 2018-19 and the Government subsidy for mechanisation will
increase mechanisation coverage amongst small farmers. An
increasing trend of more farmers taking technical advice in
agriculture, also reflects the growth of progressive farmers.
High international commodity prices and logistic disruptions may
aggravate input costs leading to inflation. Quantitatively, the
southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is
likely to be 106% of the long period average (LPA) with a model error
of ± 4%. Thus, above-normal rainfall is most likely over the country as
a whole during the monsoon season (June to September, 2024).
Coupled with timely arrival of southwest monsoon in Kerala and
northeastern states, this has improved the on-ground sentiments of
farmers. Land preparation activities for Kharif crops are expected to
begin on time, which are likely to boost tractor demand in coming
months.

STRATEGY
AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
Your Company has been firing on all cylinders, moving from strength
to strength this year. We reinforced our place as the #1 SUV player by
revenue-share in the Indian market and are now the #2 Passenger
Vehicle manufacturer by revenue. Mahindra LCVs and electric
3-wheelers dominate their respective segments with #1 market
share and our Trucks and Buses business grew 15X faster than the
industry.
External investors continue to show faith in our EV vision. The Last
Mile Mobility business entered into agreements to raise Rs. 1,000
crores at a valuation of over Rs. 6,000 crores from two external
investors, International Finance Corporation and India-Japan Fund (a
fund managed by National Investment and Infrastructure Fund
Limited). We added another marquee investor, Temasek, in Mahindra
Electric Automobile Limited (MEAL) for an investment of Rs. 1,200
crores (in addition to the previous investment from British
International Investment Plc) at a valuation of up to Rs. 80,580 crores.
We made heads turn at our Cape Town event where we revealed the
future Lifestyle Global Pickup and the stunning Thar.e concept.
Bringing these concepts to life is the diverse and talented workforce
at Mahindra Research Valley, our flagship R&D and innovation centre.
MRV continues making strides in cutting-edge areas such as EVs,
Software Defined Vehicle, Digital Platforms and more with 612
patents granted.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

Mahindra Accelerated Leadership Track (MALT):
We have partnered with Carnegie Mellon University
to develop an industry-leading accelerator
programme called MALT. This track seeks to identify
mid-career high potential talent from within the
diverse Mahindra businesses annually and prepare
them for an exciting career within the group. 71
associates across 2 batches have graduated so far.
The third batch of 34 associates kickstarted their
year-long journey in January 2024.

These strategic initiatives reflect our commitment to nurturing
leadership talent, upskilling our workforce, and empowering
individuals to reach their fullest potential, driving sustained success
for Mahindra.

Future Shapers: We initiated the Mahindra Future
Shapers programme with the intent to identify and
nurture the next generation of leaders within our
organization, consolidating their capabilities and
preparing them to drive our Company's growth. The
programme is being delivered through our long-term
strategic tie-up with Harvard University and leading
consulting firms. With two batches of 58 participants
successfully concluded and the third batch ongoing,
we are leveraging our strategic partnership with
Harvard University and top consulting firms.

Our learning experience platform now consolidates our
various digital learning content providers under a single
umbrella for the learner and by leveraging the power of
artificial intelligence and machine learning, it can provide
highly personalized learning content to our employees
across the Group. Furthermore, we have been able to
leverage the platform well beyond standardized elearnings and have driven 50+ engagements across the
year on the platform. This has led to both a high adoption
rate as well as learner NPS. In FY 2023-24, we have seen
100% adoption rate and more than 1 million items of
learning consumed. We believe this is a testament to our
skills first approach of capability development and we
anticipate further demand for learning content over FY

INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
Your Company maintains adequate internal control systems
commensurate with the nature of its business and size and
complexity of its operations. These are regularly tested for their
effectiveness by Statutory as well as Management Auditors. Your
Company's Internal Financial Controls are deployed through the
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway

Legal Compliance Framework,
Internal Audit and Anti-Fraud
Mechanisms such as Ethics
Framework, Code of Conduct,
Whistle-Blower Policy, etc.),
process level controls, information
technology-based controls, period

The Company’s success is defined by its financial performance, but also
equally by its ability to make the world a better place. Two years ago, the
Company unveiled its ‘Planet Positive’ strategy - a comprehensive approach
to environment sustainability that goes beyond emissions and own operations,
recognising the interrelated challenges in areas like circularity, supply chain
decarbonisation, developing a portfolio of green offerings, and moving the
broader ecosystem forward. The approach is geared towards greening own
operations, supporting decarbonisation of the Company’s industries, and
rejuvenating nature, while incorporating principles of just transition. The
Company continues to progress on greening its operations by focusing on
renewable energy, energy efficiency, water conservation, waste management
and bringing in principle material circularity.
True leadership transcends compliance. The Company aspires to be a global
leader, pioneering sustainability solutions well before necessitated by
regulations or stakeholders. The Company’s efforts are recognised by key global
organisation, including DJSI and CDP. Collaboration, partnerships and advocacy
are crucial to accelerate action. The Company is also actively pursuing crossindustry collaborations to drive change.
While the Company has achieved notable progress, it still has a long way to
go. The Company is committed to the ‘Citizens of the Future’, and sincerely
appreciates the support from all its stakeholders.

disposed of safely, thus fulfilling all the process requirements needed for ZLD certification. All the manufacturing plants
of the Company are ZLD certified, except one.
•	Most of the plants have recharging pits for injecting rainwater to deep aquifers.
•	Though the Company relies more heavily on freshwater, recycled water is, and will continue to be, important for the
Company to secure enough water to manufacture vehicles and parts. The Company recycled 39% of fresh water
through wastewater recycling plants.

4

Energy efficient blower for paint shop

In paint shops, high energy is consumed by the conventional
blowers. This has been replaced with energy efficient EC
(electronically computed) motors. This motor consumes around
30% less energy compared to conventional fans. These fans
were installed at Nasik, Chakan and Rudrapur plants in the
past 2 years. Also the Company has replaced around 1700 air
ciculators/Fan with BLDC tech fans which saves more energy.

Reduction of GHG emissions &
Reduction in energy costs

5

Wastewater recycling

At Chakan and Kandivali plants of Auto division, a new
containerized reverse osmosis plant is installed which treats
the STP & ETP treated water and converts wastewater into
fresh water with potable quality water. The permeated water
is used again for processes and cooling tower.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited
 Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (the “Company”) which comprise the standalone balance sheet as
at 31 March 2024, and the standalone statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), standalone statement of changes in equity
and standalone statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including material accounting policies
and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2024, and its profit and other comprehensive income, changes
in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those
SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of
the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that
are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
 Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of
the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Impairment assessment of certain long-term investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
See Note 2(d)(iv) to standalone financial statements
The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

The Company has long-term investments in subsidiaries, joint
ventures and associates (collectively “the investments”) aggregating
Rs. 21,549 crores as at 31 March 2024.

Our audit procedures included:

The Company records the investments at cost less any provision for
impairment loss. Changes in business environment, including market or
economic environment, geopolitical situations and general inflationary
trends could have a significant impact on the valuation of certain
investments. Investments where an indication based on these factors
exists, are tested for impairment at the end of the reporting period.
The Company determines the recoverable value of such investments
and compares it to its carrying amount to determine impairment loss.
The recoverable value is determined basis following key assumptions:
•

projected future cash inflows;

•

expected growth rate; discount rate; terminal growth rate;

•

comparison of price and market multiples

The recoverable amount, which is the higher of the market value or
Value In Use (VIU) or fair value less cost of disposal of such investments
(FVLCS), is estimated and the impairment loss, if any, is recognised in
the statement of profit and loss and carrying amount of investments is
reduced to its recoverable amount. The impairment test is considered to
be a key audit matter considering the significant judgements required in
determining the key assumptions.

•	Assessed the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of
key controls in respect of the Company’s impairment assessment
process, including the approval of forecasts and valuation models;
•	Obtained an understanding of various external factors impacting the
recoverable value of the respective investment as at the end of the
reporting period;
•	Involved valuation specialists, as applicable, to evaluate the
appropriateness of the valuation models used, assumptions such as
the discount rates used in VIU calculations and comparable companies
considered in the FVLCS model;
•	Tested the key VIU assumptions used in estimating future cash flows
such as revenue volumes and prices, operating costs, inflation and
growth rates by comparing these inputs with externally derived data,
past performances, consistency with the Board approved investment
plans and knowledge of the industry;
•	Evaluated past performance where relevant, and assessed historical
accuracy of the forecast produced by management; and
•	Assessed the adequacy of disclosures on key judgements, assumptions
and quantitative data with respect to impairment losses.

Impairment assessment of intangible assets currently under development in the Automotive cash generating unit
See Note 2(g) to standalone financial statements
The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

The Company has identified its Automotive business segment as a
separate cash generating unit (‘Auto CGU’). The Company holds intangible
assets under development and tests its cash generating units (‘Auto
CGU’) for impairment at least annually.

Our audit procedures included:

For the purpose of the impairment test, the Company determines
recoverable value of the Auto CGU which is the higher of Value In
Use (VIU) or Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal (FVLCS). The recoverable
value is dependent on certain assumptions and estimates of future
performance and management’s plans for continuation of the projects.

•	Involved valuation specialists as applicable, to evaluate the
appropriateness of the valuation models including assumptions such
as the discount rates used in VIU calculations;

On discontinuing individual projects under development, an impairment
loss relating to the specific project is recognised in the statement of
profit and loss.
Changes in business environment, including market or economic
environment, geopolitical situations and general inflationary trends
could have a significant impact on the valuation of the Auto CGU and
management’s plan for specific projects under development. This annual
impairment test is considered to be a key audit matter considering the
significant judgements required in determining the key assumptions.

•	Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key
controls in respect of the Company’s impairment assessment process,
including the approval of forecasts and valuation models;

•	Tested the key VIU assumptions used in estimating future cash flows
such as revenue volumes and prices, operating costs, inflation and
growth rates by comparing these inputs with externally derived data,
past performances, consistency with the Board approved investment
plans and knowledge of the industry;
•	Evaluated past performance where relevant, and assessed historical
accuracy of the forecast produced by management; and
•	Evaluated the stage of development of the intangible assets,
judgments used for expected probable economic benefits and
associated expenditures, management plans for continuation of
projects and their assessment of feasibility of the projects.

Other Information
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report thereon. The annual report is expected to be
made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it
becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or
our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to
those charged with governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the
preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit / loss and other comprehensive
income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of

294

assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
We also:
•	Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has
adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made
by the Management and Board of Directors.
•	Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation
of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether
the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,
and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the
audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine
that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal
financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control
stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial
information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses at the date of these financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the years presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
		Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in
which the estimate is revised and future periods affected.
		Key sources of estimation uncertainty, critical judgments and assumptions at the date of financial statements, which may cause a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are in respect of the below:
		

(i)

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets - refer note 2(e) and 2(f).

		

(ii)

Provision for product warranties - refer note 2(q) and note 21.

		

(iii)

Fair value of financial assets, liabilities and investments - refer note 41(f).

		

(iv) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets including investments - refer note 2(g).

		

(v)

		

(vi) Recoverability of deferred tax asset on unabsorbed losses - refer note 2(p) and note 22.

(e)

Classification of investment as subsidiary, associate or joint venture - refer note 2(j).

Property, plant and equipment

		Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment,
if any.
		Cost includes financing cost relating to borrowed funds attributable to the construction or acquisition of qualifying tangible assets upto the date
the assets are ready for use.
		Depreciation is provided on straight-line basis for property, plant and equipment so as to expense the depreciable amount, i.e. the cost less
estimated residual value, over its estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and the effect of any
changes in estimate is accounted for on a prospective basis.
		When an asset is scrapped or otherwise disposed off, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the books of account and
resultant profit or loss, if any, is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

		

The amortisation period for intangible assets are reviewed annually and changes in expected useful lives are treated as changes in estimates..

(g) Impairment of assets
		At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets , intangible assets and investments in
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the value in use or fair value less cost to sell, of the asset or cash-generating
unit, as the case may be, is estimated and impairment loss (if any) is recognised and the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount.
		In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value. When it is not possible to estimate the
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
		When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate
of its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) earlier.
		Intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
(h)

Inventories

		Inventories are carried at cost or net realisable value whichever is lower. Cost is determined on the basis of the weighted average method and
comprises of all cost of purchase, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
(i)

Foreign exchange transactions and translation

		Transactions in foreign currencies i.e. other than the Company’s functional currency of Indian Rupees are recognised at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value is determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms
of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period
in which they arise except for exchange differences on transactions entered into in order to hedge certain foreign currency risks (refer policy on
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting).

Material accounting policies (contd.)

(j)	Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
		The Company assesses if it has acquired control, joint control or significant influence over an investee based on shareholding, voting power, composition
of board, rights under shareholder agreements and other facts and circumstances of each case which involves use of judgment.
		
(k)

The Company accounts for its equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment, if any.

Offsetting
		Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Balance Sheet when, and only when, the Company currently
has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously.

Financial instruments

		Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
		Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition
or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are
added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs
directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately
in profit or loss. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.
Classification and subsequent measurement
		Financial assets
		All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are
purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value depending on their respective classification.
		

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at

		

—

Amortised cost - debt instrument; or

		

—

Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) - debt instrument; or

		

—

Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) - equity instrument; or

		

—

Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

		The classification of debt instrument as amortised cost or FVTOCI is based on the business model and cash flow characteristics of such instrument.
		Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if the Company changes its business model for managing
financial assets.
		A financial asset not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI is measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets unless
designated as effective hedge instruments which are accounted as per hedge accounting requirements discussed below.
		Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced
by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment expenses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain and
loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.
		For equity investments other than investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, the Company makes an election on an instrumentby-instrument basis to designate equity investments as measured at FVTOCI. These elected investments are measured at fair value with gains
and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the reserves. The cumulative gain
or loss is not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the investments. These equity investments are not held for trading. Dividend income
received on such equity investments are recognised in profit or loss.
		Equity investments that are not designated to be measured at Cost or FVTOCI are designated to be measured at FVTPL. Subsequent changes
in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
		Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
		Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-fortrading or it is a derivative (that does not meet hedge accounting requirements) or it is designated as such on initial recognition.
Derecognition of financial assets
		The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights
to receive the contractual cash flows from financial asset in a manner that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are
transferred to another party. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to
control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for the amount it may have to pay.
		If the Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its Balance Sheet, but retains either all or substantially all
of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognised and the proceeds received are recognised as a
collateralised borrowing.

310

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
		The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps, to manage its
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are not financial assets within the
scope of Ind AS 109 are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts
and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
		Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the
end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective
as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the
nature of the hedged item.
		The Company designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
		At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and
on an ongoing basis, the Company documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows
of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Impairment of financial assets
		The Company applies the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for recognising impairment loss on financial assets. With respect to trade receivables
and loans, the Company measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
		The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This
is generally the case when the Company determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash
flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities under
the Company’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.
(l)

Revenue Recognition
Sale of goods or services

		Revenue from sale of goods are recognised upon satisfaction of performance obligation which is at a point in time, generally on delivery of the
goods, when control of the goods is transferred to customers. Revenue from services are recognised upon satisfaction of performance obligation
towards rendering of such services.
		The Company recognises revenue from sale of goods or services at the amount of transaction price (excluding variable consideration that is
constrained), that is allocated to the performance obligation satisfied. Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company
expects it to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
		An amount of consideration can vary because of discounts, rebates, incentives etc. which are explicitly stated in the contract or are as per customary
business practices. The consideration can also vary where the entitlement is contingent on occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event. The
Company includes variable consideration as part of transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the
amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
Variable consideration is estimated using the expected value method or the most likely amount depending on which method the Company expects
to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled and is applied consistently throughout the contract.
		Payment terms agreed with a customer are as per business practice and the financing component, if significant, is separated from the transaction
price and accounted as interest income / expense, as applicable.
Dividend and interest income
		

Dividend from investments are recognised in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established.

		Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of
income can be measured reliably.
		Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.

(m) Government Grants

		Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint
arrangements to the extent that the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

		The Company, directly or indirectly through a consortium of Mahindra Group companies, is entitled to various incentives from government authorities.
Government grants are recognised when there is a reasonable assurance that the same will be received and all attached conditions will be complied
with.
		Government grants that are revenue in nature, are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company
recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.
(n)
		

Employee Benefits
Superannuation Fund, ESIC and Labour Welfare Fund

		The Company’s contribution paid / payable during the year to Superannuation Fund, ESIC and Labour Welfare Fund are recognised in profit or loss.
		Provident Fund
		Contributions to Provident Fund are made to a Trust administered by the Company / Regional Provident Fund Commissioners and are charged to
profit or loss as incurred. The Company is liable for the contribution and any shortfall in interest between the amount of income earned by the Trust
and the interest payable to members at the rate declared by the Government of India in respect of the Trust administered by the Company. For
such trust the shortfall and remeasurement thereof, if any, based on actuarial valuation is recognised through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).
Gratuity, long term compensated absences, post retirement medical benefit and post retirement housing allowance schemes

Material accounting policies (contd.)

		The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
(q)

Provisions

		Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Company
will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is
the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount
is the present value of these cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).
		Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations are recognised at the time of sale of the relevant products, at the best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the Company’s obligation. The provisions are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current
best estimate.
(r)

Leases
The Company as a lessee

		The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost.

		The liability towards gratuity, long term compensated absences, post retirement medical benefit and post retirement housing allowance schemes
are determined by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.

		The right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. In
addition, the right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

		Remeasurement of defined benefit plans, comprising of actuarial gains or losses, return on plan assets excluding interest income are recognised
immediately in Balance Sheet with corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or
loss in subsequent period.

		The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments, discounted using the interest rate
implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, using the incremental borrowing rate.

		Remeasurement gains or losses on long term compensated absences that are classified as other long term benefits are recognised in profit or loss.
Share based payments
		Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the
Company’s estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity.
(o)

Borrowing Costs

		Borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial
period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready
for their intended use or sale except for the period the construction activities are temporarily suspended. All other borrowing costs are recognised
in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
(p)

Income taxes

		Current tax
		The Company’s current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
		Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset, if entity has a legally enforceable right to set off recognised amounts and intends to settle
on net basis or to realise the current tax asset and settle the current tax liabilities simultaneously.
		Deferred tax
		Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset
realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement
of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end
of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
		Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities, and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
		Deferred tax assets including that on unused tax losses and unused tax credits are recognised to the extent that it is probable and there is
convincing evidence that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences could be utilised.

		It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Company’s
estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will
exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.
		When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is
recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
		The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or
less and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.
The Company as lessor
		When the Company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.
		Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance
lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
		When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified
as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.
		The Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(s)

Business Combination

		Business Combination under common control are accounted under “the pooling of interest method” i.e. in accordance with Appendix C in Ind AS 103
- Business combinations, at carrying amount of assets and liabilities acquired and any excess of consideration issued over the net assets acquired
is recognised as capital reserve on common control business combination.
(t)

Non-current assets held for sale

		Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying
value and fair value less costs to sell.

38. Employee Benefits
(a)

General description of defined benefit plans:

		(i)

38. Employee Benefits (contd.)
(c)

Details of defined benefit plans as per actuarial valuation are as below:
Rupees crores

Gratuity

			The Company operates a gratuity plan covering qualifying employees. The benefit payable is the greater of the amount calculated as per the
Payment of Gratuity Act or the Company scheme applicable to the employee. The benefit vests upon completion of five years of continuous
service and once vested it is payable to employees on retirement or on termination of employment. In case of death while in service, the
gratuity is payable irrespective of vesting. The Company makes annual contribution to the group gratuity scheme administered by the Life
Insurance Corporation of India through its Gratuity Trust Fund.

Particulars

		(ii)

(i) Amounts recognised in profit or loss

Post - retirement medical

			The Company provides post retirement medical cover to select grade of employees to cover the retiring employee and their spouse upto a
specified age through mediclaim policy on which the premiums are paid by the Company. The eligibility of the employee for the benefit as well
as the amount of medical cover purchased is determined by the grade of the employee at the time of retirement.
		

(iii) Post - retirement housing allowance

			The Company operates a post retirement benefit scheme for a certain grade of employees in which a monthly allowance determined on the
basis of the last drawn basic salary at the time of retirement, is paid to the retiring employee in lieu of housing.
(b)
		

Risk exposure
Though its defined benefit plans the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

		(i)

Asset volatility

			The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with references to government bond yields; if plan assets underperform compared
to this yield, this will create or increase a deficit. The defined benefit plans may hold equity type assets, which may carry volatility and
associated risk.
		(ii)

Changes in bond yields

			A decrease in government bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this is expected to be partially offset by an increase in the value
of the plan’s investment in debt instruments.
		

(iii) Inflation risk

			The present value of some of the defined benefit plan obligations are calculated with reference to the future salaries of plan participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. The post retirement medical benefit obligation is
sensitive to medical inflation and accordingly, an increase in medical inflation rate would increase the plan’s liability.
		(iv) Life expectancy
			The present value of defined benefit plan obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants, both
during and after the employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

			The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on exposure to interest rate for both derivative and non-derivative instruments
at the end of reporting period. For floating rate liabilities, analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the
reporting period, was outstanding for the whole year.
			The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings
affected, after the impact of hedge accounting. With all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit before tax is affected through the

			In respect of other financial assets, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each
class of financial assets.

the arrangement for the full guaranteed amount if that amount is claimed by the counterparty to the guarantee. Based on expectations
at the end of the reporting period, the Company considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under
the arrangement.

Valuation methodologies of financial instruments not measured at fair value

		Below are the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for the above financial instruments which are not recorded and
measured at fair value in the company’s financial statements. These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only.
Non-Current Borrowings
		The fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price and for other borrowings the fair
value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk- free rate of return, adjusted for the credit
spread considered by the lenders for instruments of similar maturity and credit quality.
		

Except for the above, carrying value of financial assets / liabilities measured at amortised cost represent reasonable estimate of fair value.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited
 Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) and its
subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), its associates and its joint ventures, which comprise the consolidated
balance sheet as at 31 March 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of
changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material
accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of reports of the other
auditors on separate/consolidated financial statements of such subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures as were audited by the other auditors, the
aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true
and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, its associates and
joint ventures as at 31 March 2024, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash
flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those
SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent
of the Group, its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial
statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the
consideration of reports of the other auditors referred to in paragraph (a) of the “Other Matters” section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
 Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate/
consolidated financial statements of components audited by them, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the
current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Impairment assessment of intangible assets currently under development in the Automotive Cash Generating Unit (CGU)
See Note 2(h) to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

The Group has identified its Automotive business segment as a separate
cash generating unit (‘Auto CGU’). The Group holds intangible assets under
development and tests its CGU (‘Auto CGU’) for impairment atleast annually.

Our audit procedures included:

For the purpose of the impairment test, the Group determines
recoverable value of the Auto CGU which is the higher of Value In Use
(VIU) or Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal (FVLCS). The recoverable value is
dependent on certain assumptions and estimates of future performance
and management’s plans for continuation of the projects.
On discontinuing individual projects under development, an impairment
loss relating to the specific project is recognised in the statement of
profit and loss.
Changes in business environment, including market or economic
environment, geopolitical situations and general inflationary trends
could have a significant impact on the valuation of the Auto CGU and
management’s plan for specific projects under development. This annual
impairment test is considered to be a key audit matter considering the
significant judgements required in determining the key assumptions.

•	Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness

of key controls in respect of the Group’s impairment assessment
process, including the approval of forecasts and valuation models;

•	Involved valuation specialists as applicable, to evaluate the

appropriateness of the valuation models including assumptions
such as the discount rates used in VIU calculations;

•	Tested the key VIU assumptions used in estimating future cash

flows such as revenue volumes and prices, operating costs, inflation
and growth rates by comparing these inputs with externally derived
data, past performance, consistency with the respective entity’s
Board approved investment plans and knowledge of the industry;

•	Evaluated past performance where relevant, and assessed historical
accuracy of the forecast produced by management; and

•	Evaluated the stage of development of the intangible assets,

judgments used for expected probable economic benefits and
associated expenditures, management plans for continuation of
projects and their assessment of feasibility of the projects.

Allowances for Expected Credit Losses (“ECL”) in the financial services business

 Other Information

See Note 2(e)(v) to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
As at 31 March 2024, the carrying value of loan assets
measured at amortised cost, aggregated Rs 106,344 crores
(net of allowance of expected credit loss Rs 3,682 crores).
Significant judgement is used in classifying these loan assets
and applying appropriate measurement principles. ECL on such
loan assets measured at amortised cost is a critical estimate
involving greater level of management judgement. As part of
risk assessment, the component joint auditors determined that
the ECL on such loan assets has a high degree of estimation
uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes
for the consolidated financial statements. The elements of
estimating ECL which involved increased level of audit focus are
the following:

The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the Holding Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report thereon. The
Holding Company’s annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.

•	Qualitative and quantitative factors used in staging the
loan assets measured at amortised cost;

•	Basis used for estimating Probabilities of Default (“PD”),

Loss Given Default (“LGD”) and Exposure at Default (“EAD”)
at product level with past trends;

•	Judgements used in projecting economic scenarios and

probability weights applied to reflect future economic
conditions; and

•	Adjustments to model driven ECL results to address
emerging trends.

How the matter was addressed in our audit
The audit procedures applied by the component joint auditors of the component
included:
Examined the policies approved by the respective Board of Directors of the
component that articulate the objectives of managing each portfolio and their
business models. Component joint auditors also verified the methodology
adopted for computation of ECL (“ECL Model”) that addresses policies approved
by the respective Board of Directors, procedures and controls for assessing and
measuring credit risk on all lending exposures measured at amortised cost. The audit
procedures related to the allowance for ECL included the following, among others:
Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the following:

•	Completeness and accuracy of the Exposure at Default (“EAD”) and the

classification thereof into stages consistent with the definitions applied in
accordance with the policy approved by the respective component’s Board of
Directors including the appropriateness of the qualitative factors to be applied;

•	Completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of information used in the
estimation of the PD and LGD for the different stages depending on the
nature of the portfolio; and

•	Accuracy of the computation of the ECL estimate including reasonableness

of the methodology used to determine macro-economic adjustment basis
forward looking information.

Test of details on a sample in respect of the following:
•	Accuracy and completeness of the input data such as period of default and
other related information used in estimating the PD;

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it
becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the Holding Company’s annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate
the matter to those charged with governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Information Technology and General Controls in financial services business:
The key audit matter
The financial services business of Group is dependent on its
Information Technology (“IT”) systems due to the significant
number of transactions that are processed daily across such
multiple and discrete IT systems. Also, IT application controls are
critical to ensure that changes to applications and underlying
data are made in an appropriate manner and under controlled
environments. Appropriate controls contribute to mitigating
the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to
applications and data. On account of the pervasive use of its
IT systems, the testing of the general computer controls of the
IT systems used in financial reporting was considered to be a
Key Audit Matter.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

How the matter was addressed in our audit
The audit procedures applied by the joint auditors of the component included:
With the assistance of IT specialists, the joint auditors of the subsidiary obtained
an understanding of the Component’s IT applications, databases and operating
systems relevant to financial reporting and the control environment. For these
elements of the IT infrastructure the areas of focus included access security

management and network operations. In particular:
•
Joint auditors of component tested the design, implementation, and
operating effectiveness of the financial services business’s general IT
controls over the IT systems relevant to financial reporting. This included
evaluation of controls over segregation of duties and access rights being
provisioned / modified based on duly approved requests, access for exit
cases being revoked in a timely manner and access of all users being
recertified during the period of audit.

•	
Joint Auditors of the component also tested key automated business cycle

controls and logic for the reports generated through the IT infrastructure
that were relevant for financial reporting or were used in the exercise of
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Tests
included testing of the compensating controls or alternate procedures to
assess whether there were any unaddressed IT risks that would materiality
impact the Financial Statements.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

•	Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform

audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

•	Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under

Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

•	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management
and Board of Directors.

•	Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated

financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group
and its associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.

•	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

•	Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements of such entities or business activities within the Group and its associates

b.	In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law relating to preparation of the aforesaid consolidated financial statements have been
kept so far as it appears from our examination of those books and the reports of the other auditors except for the matters stated in the
paragraph 2(B)(f) below on reporting under Rule 11(g) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014.

and joint ventures to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the
other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for
the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in
this regard are further described in paragraph (a) of the section titled “Other Matters” in this audit report.

c.	The consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), the consolidated
statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows dealt with by this Report are in agreement with the relevant
books of account maintained for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of
which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

e.	On the basis of the written representations received from the directors of the Holding Company as on 01 April 2024 taken on record by the
Board of Directors of the Holding Company and the reports of the statutory auditors of its subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint
ventures incorporated in India, none of the directors of the Group companies, its associate companies and joint ventures incorporated in India
is disqualified as on 31 March 2024 from being appointed as a director in terms of Section 164(2) of the Act.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and
to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the consolidated financial statements
of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited for the year ended 31 March 2024
 Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under Clause (i) of
Sub‑section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) as
of and for the year ended 31 March 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company and
such companies incorporated in India under the Act which are its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and joint ventures, as of that date.
In our opinion and based on the consideration of reports of the other auditors on internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of
subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint ventures, as were audited by the other auditors, the Holding Company and such companies incorporated
in India which are its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and joint ventures, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal financial controls
with reference to financial statements criteria established by such companies considering the essential components of such internal controls stated in the
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on
the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the respective company considering the essential components
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and
the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an
audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the relevant subsidiary companies, associate
companies and joint ventures in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

378

Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements insofar as it relates to 47 subsidiaries, 7 associates and 14 joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the
corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.
The internal financial controls with reference to financial statements insofar as it relates to 2 subsidiaries, 2 associates and 2 joint ventures, which are
companies incorporated in India and included in these consolidated financial statements, have not been audited either by us or by other auditors. In our
opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us by the Management, such unaudited subsidiary company, associate companies and
joint ventures are not material to the Holding Company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
—

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

(c)

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.

		Subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis from the date the control is transferred to the Group. Investment in associates and joint
ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost. These financial statements are prepared
by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group.
		Changes in the Group’s interest in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted as equity transactions. In case of loss of control
of a subsidiary, the gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. The fair value of any investment retained at the date when control is lost is regarded
as the cost on initial recognition of investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity or as the fair value on initial recognition of investment
classified as a financial asset, as the case may be.
(d)

Measurement of fair values

		A number of Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and
liabilities. The Group has established policies and procedures with respect to the measurement of fair values.

		The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses at the date of these financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the years presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

		Key sources of estimation uncertainty, critical judgments and assumptions at the date of financial statements which may cause a material adjustment
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are in respect of the below:

Property, plant and equipment

		Cost includes financing cost relating to borrowed funds attributable to the construction or acquisition of qualifying tangible assets upto the date
the assets are ready for use.
		Depreciation is provided on straight-line basis for property, plant and equipment so as to expense the depreciable amount, i.e. the cost less
estimated residual value, over its estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and the effect of any
changes in estimate is accounted for on a prospective basis.
		The management’s estimate of useful lives are in accordance with Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, other than the following asset classes,
based on the Group’s expected usage pattern supported by technical assessment:
Asset Class

Useful lives

(i)

Plant and equipment

2-25 years

(ii)

Buildings, including roads

3-60 years

(iii)

Vehicles

2-10 years

		Goodwill
		Goodwill is initially recognised as the excess of consideration paid/payable over acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets of
the acquired business. Subsequent to initial measurement, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment, if any. Goodwill is allocated
to the cash-generating unit which is expected to benefit from the business combination.
		Intangile assets
Intangible assets under development

		The Group expenses costs incurred during research phase to profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred. Development phase expenses
are initially recognised as intangible assets under development until the development phase is complete, upon which the amount is capitalised as
intangible assets.
		

Other intangible assets

		Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost except those acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
are recognised separately from goodwill and are initially recognised at their fair value on the acquisition date which is regarded as their cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortised on a straight line basis so as to reflect the pattern in
which the asset’s economic benefits are consumed and are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses,
if any.
		The other intangible assets are amortised over the estimated period of benefit as below:

(j)

Foreign exchange transactions and translation

		The functional currency of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is Indian Rupees whereas the functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective entity operates.
		Transactions in foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting
period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange
differences on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for exchange differences on transactions
entered into in order to hedge certain foreign currency risks (refer policy on Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting).

		On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of control over
a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an associate that includes a foreign
operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation
attributable to the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.
		In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that does not result in the Group losing control over
the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in
profit or loss. For all other partial disposal (i.e. partial disposals of associates or joint arrangements that do not result in the Group losing significant
influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.
(k)
		

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.

		Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue
of financial assets or financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss) are added
to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or
loss. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.
Classification and subsequent measurement

Asset Class

Useful lives

		Financial assets

i)

Development expenditure

3-5 years

ii)

Software expenditure

3-10 years

		All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. All recognised financial assets are
subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value depending on their respective classification.

iii)

Brand license fee and trademarks

6-30 years

iv)

Technical knowhow

3-10 years

v)	Others (excluding Transferable Development Rights)

2-30 years

		The amortisation period for intangible assets are reviewed annually and changes in expected useful lives are treated as changes in estimates.
(h)

Inventories

		Inventories are carried at cost or net realisable value whichever is lower. Cost is determined on the basis of the weighted average method and
comprises of all cost of purchase, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

		For the purposes of presenting these consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated
into Indian Rupees using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (and attributed
to non-controlling interests as appropriate).

(g) Goodwill and Intangible Assets

		

Material Accounting Policies (Continued)
(i)

		Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, if any.

388

Impairment of Assets

		At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets and investments in associates
and joint ventures to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists,
the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the value in use or fair value less cost to sell, of the asset or cash-generating unit, as the case may
be, is estimated and impairment loss (if any) is recognised and the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount.
		In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value. When it is not possible to estimate the
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
		Except for goodwill, when an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) earlier.
		Goodwill, intangible assets and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an
indication that the asset may be impaired.

		

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at:

		

—

Amortised cost - debt instrument; or

		

—

Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) - debt instrument; or

		

—

Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) - equity instrument; or

		

—

Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

		The classification of debt instrument as amortised cost or FVTOCI is based on the business model and cash flow characteristics of such instrument.
		Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if the Group changes its business model for managing
financial assets.
		A financial asset not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI is measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets unless
designated as effective hedge instruments which are accounted as per hedge accounting requirements discussed below.
		For equity investments other than investments in associates and joint ventures, the Group makes an election on an instrument-by-instrument basis
to designate equity investments as measured at FVTOCI. These elected investments are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from
changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the reserves. The cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified
to profit or loss on disposal of the investments. These equity investments are not held for trading. Dividend income received on such equity
investments are recognised in profit or loss.

2. Material Accounting Policies (Continued)
		Equity investments that are not designated to be measured at FVTOCI are designated to be measured at FVTPL and subsequent changes in fair
value are recognised in profit or loss.
		Where the Group is a holder of a financial instrument that is a hybrid instrument or a compound instrument, such financial instrument is assessed
in its entirety and the financial asset as a whole is measured at FVTPL if the contractual cash flow characteristics test is not met.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
		Debt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
		Equity instruments issued by the Group is recognised at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
		Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-fortrading or it is a derivative (that does not meet hedge accounting requirements) or it is designated as such on initial recognition.
		Compound instruments
		An issued financial instrument that comprises of both the liability and equity components are accounted as compound financial instruments i.e.
split into debt and equity components. The transaction costs related to compound instruments are allocated to the liability and equity components
in the proportion to the allocation of gross proceeds. Transaction costs related to equity component is recognised directly in equity and the cost
related to liability component is included in the carrying amount of the liability component and amortised using effective interest method.
Derecognition of financial assets
		The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights
to receive the contractual cash flows from financial asset in a manner that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are
transferred to another party. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to
control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for the amount it may have to pay.
		If the Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, but retains either all or substantially all of
the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognised and the proceeds received are recognised as a
collateralised borrowing.
Offsetting
		Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Group currently has
a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
		The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure
to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are not financial assets within the scope of
Ind AS 109 are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and economic characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts
and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
		Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the
end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective
as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the
nature of the hedged item.
		The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges or cash
flow hedges. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
		At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with
its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an
ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Impairment of financial assets
		The Group applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for recognising impairment loss on financial assets.
		With respect to trade receivables, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
		For financial services business, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the
loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 month ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be recognised
is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition. 12 month ECL represents the portion of
lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
		The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery.
This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash
flows to repay the amounts subject to the write - off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities
under the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.

Revenue Recognition
Sale of Goods or Services

		Revenue from sale of goods are recognised upon satisfaction of performance obligation which is at a point in time, generally on delivery of the
goods, when control of the goods is transferred to dealers / customers. Revenue from services are recognised upon satisfaction of performance
obligation towards rendering of such services.
		The Group recognises revenue from sale of goods or services at the amount of transaction price (excluding variable consideration that is constrained),
that is allocated to the performance obligation satisfied. Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects it to be
entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
		An amount of consideration can vary because of discounts, rebates, incentives etc. which are explicitly stated in the contract or are as per
customary business practices. The consideration can also vary where the entitlement is contingent on occurrence or non-occurrence of a future
event. The Group includes variable consideration as part of transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal
in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently
resolved. Variable consideration is estimated using the expected value method or the most likely amount depending on which method the Group
expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled and is applied consistently throughout the contract.
		Payment terms agreed with a customer are as per business practice and the financing component, if significant, is separated from the transaction
price and accounted as interest income/expense, as applicable.
		

Dividend and interest income

		

Dividend from investments are recognised in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established.

		Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income
can be measured reliably.
		Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Income from financial services business
		(i)

Recognition of interest income on loans

			Interest income is recognised in Consolidated Statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method for all financial instruments
measured at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVTOCI and debt instruments designated at FVTPL.
			If expectations regarding the cash flows on the financial asset are revised for reasons other than credit risk, the adjustment is recorded as
a positive or negative adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset in the balance sheet with an increase or reduction in interest income.
The adjustment is subsequently amortised through interest income in the Consolidated Statement of profit and loss.
			When a financial asset becomes credit-impaired, the Group calculates interest income by applying the effective interest rate to the net
amortised cost of the financial asset. If the financial asset cures and is no longer credit-impaired, the Group reverts to calculating interest
income on a gross basis.
			Additional interest levied on customers for delay in repayments/ non payment of contractual cashflows is recognised on realisation. Interest
on trade advances, are recognized when they become measurable and when it is not unreasonable to expect their ultimate collection.
			

Income from bill discounting is recognised over the tenure of the instrument so as to provide a constant periodic rate of return.

		(ii)

Recognition of interest income on securitised loans

			The Group securitises certain pools of loan receivables in accordance with applicable RBI guidelines, wherein by virtue of existence of credit
enhancement, the Group is exposed to credit risk, being the expected losses that will be incurred on the transferred loan receivables to the
extent of the credit enhancement provided.
			In view of the above, the Group has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and thereby does not
meet the de-recognition criteria as set out in Ind AS 109. Consideration received in this transaction is presented as “Associated liability related
to Securitisation transactions” and the loan receivables securitised are continued to be reflected as loan assets. These loan assets are carried
at amortised cost and the interest income is recognised by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of financial assets other than creditimpaired assets.
		(iii)

Subvention income

			Subvention income received from manufacturer / dealers at the inception of the loan contracts which is directly attributable to individual
loan contracts in respect of vehicles financed is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method over the tenor of such loan
contracts measured at amortised cost. In case of subvention income which is subject to confirmation from manufacturer and received later
than inception date is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss using straight line method over the tenor of such loan contracts.
Fees, charges and commission income
		Service and administration charges income towards rendering of additional services to its loan customers is recognised at point in time upon
satisfactory completion of service delivery.
		Fees and commission that are not directly linked to the sourcing of financial assets are recognised at point in time on an accrual basis when the
right to receive the same is established.

Material Accounting Policies (Continued)

		Distribution income is earned by distribution of services and products of other entities under distribution arrangements. The income so earned is
recognised on successful distribution on behalf of other entities subject to there being no significant uncertainty of its recovery from the other
entities.

		Incremental costs of acquisition of the members are deferred over the period of effective membership in line with revenue deferral. Incremental
costs are those that would not have been incurred if the contract was not obtained. Such cost which will be amortised in the future period are
disclosed under deferred acquisition cost.

		Foreclosure charges are collected from loan customers for early payment/closure of loan and are recognised on realisation.

		Revenue is recognised only when it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue with
respect to instalments / contracts where there is an uncertainty about collectability, is deferred (even though the membership is not cancelled).
The estimation of such revenues where there is uncertainty in collection has been made by the Group based on past trends of year-wise cancellation
of memberships and considering factors impacting future collections.

		Collection fee related to transfered assets under securitisation transactions is recognised on remittance of collection proceeds to Special Purpose
Vehicle (SPV) created under securitization transaction.
Long term construction contracts and property development activity						
		Some of the Group companies are in the business to develop and sell residential and commercial properties. Revenue from such contracts is
recognised when control over the property has been transferred to the customer. An enforceable right to payment does not arise until the
development of the property is completed. Therefore, revenue is recognised at a point in time as per IND AS 115 when
		

–	The seller has transferred to the buyer all significant risks and rewards of ownership and the seller retains no effective control of the real
estate unit to a degree usually associated with ownership;

		

–	The seller has effectively handed over possession of the real estate unit to the buyer forming part of the transaction;

		

–	No significant uncertainty exists regarding the amount of consideration that will be derived from real estate unit sales; and

		

–	It is not unreasonable to expect ultimate collection of revenue from buyers. The revenue is measured at the transaction price agreed under
the contract.

		

Some of the Group companies invoices the customers for construction contracts based on achieving performance-related milestones.

		For certain contracts involving the sale of property under development, deferred payment schemes are offered to the customers. The transaction
price is adjusted for the effects of the significant financing component.
		Costs to obtain contracts (“Contract costs”) relate to fees paid for obtaining property sales contracts. Such costs are recognised as assets when
incurred and amortised upon recognition of revenue from the related property sale contract.
		Contract assets is the Group’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Group has transferred to a customer when that
right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time.
		Some of the Group companies recognise revenue at a point in time in each reporting period considering the estimates like reasonableness of
collections from customers, disputes with the customer which may result in the cancellation of the contract, which are reassessed periodically by
the management. The effect of these changes to estimates is recognised in the period when changes are determined.
Income from Sale of land and other rights
		Revenue from sale of land and other rights is generally a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this is satisfied at the
point in time when control transfers as per the terms of the contract entered into with the buyers, which generally are with the firmity of the sale
contracts / agreements.
Land Lease Premium
		Land lease premium is recognised as income upon creation of leasehold rights in favour of the lessee or upon an agreement to create leasehold
rights with handing over of possession. Property lease rentals, income from operation & maintenance charges and water charges are recognised on
an accrual basis as per terms of the agreement with the lessees.
Vacation ownership
		The Group’s business is to sell vacation ownership and provide holiday facilities to members for a specified period each year, over a number of years,
for which membership fee is collected either in full upfront, or on a deferred payment basis.
		Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price allocated to that performance obligation.
		Revenue from sale of vacation ownership weeks is recognized when related right to use the specific property over the specific weeks is transferred
to the buyer for a consideration, which coincides with transfer of significant risks, rewards and control of ownership.
		Income from sale of vacation ownership weeks in villas under construction is deferred until the point in time when construction activities are
deemed to be completed, occupancy of the development is permissible, customer has executed a binding sales contract, collectability is reasonably
assured, the purchaser’s period to cancel for a refund has expired and the customer has the right to use. Project revenue and contract costs
associated with the contract are recognised on completion of the performance obligations as mentioned above.
Revenue from Membership fees
		The Group recognises the membership fees over the tenure of membership as the performance obligation is fulfilled over the tenure of membership
(33 years / 25 years / 10 years or any other tenure applicable to the respective member). The group recognises revenue on a straight line basis
over the tenure of membership after considering the expected customer unexercised rights from date of admission of each member. The revenue
which will be recognised in future periods are disclosed under other liabilities – contract liability. Revenue from consumer offers and other benefits
provided on membership are recognised as and when such benefits are provided to members at its respective fair value. Discounts and other
incentives provided to the customers are reduced from the overall contract value.

Revenue from Annual subscription fees
		Annual subscription fee dues from members are recognised as income on accrual basis and fees pertaining to the period beyond the year end is
disclosed under Contract Liabilities and payment is due as per due date mentioned in invoice.
		

Interest income on deferred payment plans

		Interest revenue is recognised only to the extent that a contract asset (or receivable) or a contract liability is recognised in accounting for a
contract with the customer.
		Resort Income
		Income from resorts include income from room rentals, food and beverages, etc. and is recognized when services are rendered.
		Rental income
		Rental income from retail premises in case of HCR Oy are recognized on a straight line basis over the rental period.
(m) Government Grants
		The Group, directly or indirectly through a consortium of Mahindra Group companies, is entitled to various incentives from government authorities.
Government grants are recognised when there is a reasonable assurance that the same will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with.
		Government grants that are revenue in nature, are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognises
as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.
(n)
		

Employee Benefits
Superannuation Fund, ESIC and Labour Welfare Fund

		The Group’s contribution paid / payable during the year to Superannuation Fund, ESIC and Labour Welfare Fund are recognised in profit or loss.
		Provident Fund
		Contributions to Provident Fund are made to Trusts administered by the Group / Regional Provident Fund Commissioners and are charged to profit
or loss as incurred. The Group is liable for the contribution and any shortfall in interest between the amount of income earned by the Trust and
the interest payable to members at the rate declared by the Government of India in respect of the Trust administered by the Group companies. For
such Trust, the shortfall and remeasurement thereof, if any, based on actuarial valuation is recognised through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).
Gratuity, long term compensated absences, post retirement medical benefit and post retirement housing allowance schemes
		The liability towards gratuity, long term compensated absences, post retirement medical benefit and post retirement housing allowance schemes
are determined by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
		Remeasurement of defined benefit plans, comprising of actuarial gains or losses, return on plan assets excluding interest income are recognised
immediately in balance sheet with corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or
loss in subsequent period.
		Remeasurement gains or losses on long term compensated absences that are classified as other long term benefits are recognised in profit or loss.
		

Share based payments

		Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the
Group’s estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity.
		Share appreciation rights which are cash settled share-based payments are recognised as employee benefit expense over the relevant service
period. The liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
(o)

Borrowing Costs

		Borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial
period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready
for their intended use or sale except for the period the construction activities are temporarily suspended. All other borrowing costs are recognised
in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
(p)

Income taxes

		Current tax
		The Company’s current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The
current income tax expense for subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary in the respective jurisdiction
in which it operates.

2. Material Accounting Policies (Continued)
		Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset, if entity has a legally enforceable right to set off recognised amounts and intends to settle
on net basis or to realise the current tax asset and settle the current tax liabilities simultaneously.
		Deferred tax
		Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset
realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement
of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of
the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
		Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities, and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
		Deferred tax assets including that on unused tax losses and unused tax credits are recognised to the extent that it is probable and there is
convincing evidence that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences could be utilised.
		Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint
arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

2. Material Accounting Policies (Continued)
		Non-controlling interest is initially measured at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of
measurement basis is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis. Subsequent to initial acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interest
is the amount of those interest in initial recognition plus the non-controlling interest’s share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.
		When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to its acquisition-date
fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
		If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group
reports provisional amount for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amount are adjusted during the measurement
period (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amount recognised at that date.
		In consolidated financial statements, acquisition of non-controlling interest is accounted as equity transaction. The carrying amount of the Group’s
interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between
the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in
equity and attributed to owners of the Company.									
(t)

		The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
(q)

		Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations are recognised at the time of sale of the relevant products, at the best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligation. The provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current
best estimate.
(r)

Leases

		The Group as a lessee
		The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost.
		The right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
In addition, the right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments, discounted using the interest rate
implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, using the incremental borrowing rate.
		It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s
estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise
a purchase, extension or termination option.
		When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is
recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
		The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less
and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
The Group as lessor
		When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.
Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance
lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
		When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a
finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.
		The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight- line basis over the lease term.
(s)

Business combinations

		Business Combination under common control are accounted under “the pooling of interest method” i.e. in accordance with Appendix C in Ind AS 103
- Business combinations, at carrying amount of assets and liabilities acquired and any excess of consideration issued over the net assets acquired
is recognised as capital reserve on common control business combination.
		The Group accounts for business combinations that are not under common control under acquisition method of accounting. The acquiree’s identifiable
assets including liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.

Acquisition of interest in associate and joint ventures

	Acquisition of interest in an associate or a joint venture, is initially recognised at cost. Any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s
share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is regarded as goodwill, which is included in the carrying amount of
the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, after
reassessment, is recognised in equity as capital reserve in the period in which the investment is acquired.

Provisions

		Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group
will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision
is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks
and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying
amount is the present value of these cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).

394

(u)

Non-current assets held for sale

		Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying
value and fair value less costs to sell.
(v)

Hyperinflationary economies

		The Turkish economy has been designated as hyperinflationary. Accordingly, financial statements of group entities whose functional currency is
Turkish Lira have been prepared applying Ind AS 29 - ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’. This primarily involves (i) restatement
of non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost in the balance sheet and all items of income and expenses in the statement of
profit and loss, using the general price index at the balance sheet date, and (ii) recording gain or loss on net monetary position in profit or loss.
3.

Recent accounting pronouncements

	Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)
Rules as issued from time to time. There is no such notification which would have been applicable from 1st April, 2024.

Services:

	The Group tests goodwill on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the CGU to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired.
The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of the CGU or group of CGUs that benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which
represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount is determined based on higher
of value‐in‐use and fair value less cost of disposal. Where there is no basis for making a reliable estimate of the price at which an orderly transaction
to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions, the recoverable amount
is determined by value-in-use. In determining the value-in-use, cash flow projections approved by appropriate level of management are considered. In
circumstances where a reliable value-in-use estimate is difficult to make whereas market value of the asset or the CGU or group of CGUs is readily
available, the latter is used for the determination of recoverable amount with appropriate adjustments, where applicable.
	Apart from the observable market information, significant management estimates and judgments are used to determine the recoverable amounts based
on value-in-use. Key assumptions used for determination of value-in-use amount includes estimated growth rates (including terminal growth rates),
margins and discount rates. Cash flow projections are usually considered for next 3-5 years and represent management’s best estimate about future
developments with due consideration for past performance. Cash flows beyond the five‐year period are extrapolated using terminal growth rates.
	In certain cases, the performance of the cash generating units were below their expected levels. Accordingly, the Group assessed such cash generating
units for the recoverable amounts based on fair value less cost of disposal and value-in-use estimates.
	The value-in-use calculation for the year used discount rates ranging from 11.60% to 18.90% (2023: 11.70% to 18.90%) and the terminal growth
rates ranging from 2% to 5% (2023: 2% to 5%).
	The goodwill impairment recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and the operating segments to which it relates are as below:
(a)

‘Farm Equipment’ segment - Rs. 32.52 crores (2023: Rs. 78.73 crores). This relates to goodwill allocated to an international subsidiary.

(b)

‘Financial services’ segment - Nil (2023: Rs. 43.40 crores). This relates to goodwill allocated to an international subsidiary.

	Goodwill impairment has been included under ‘ Depreciation, amortisation and impairment expense’ for the year ended 31st March 2024 and as
‘Exceptional items (net)’ for the year ended 31st March 2023 in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

37. Employee Benefits
(a)
		

General description of defined benefit plans
(i)

Gratuity and pension plans

			The Company and some of the group entities in India operate a gratuity plan covering qualifying employees. The benefit payable is the greater
of the amount calculated as per the Payment of Gratuity Act or the Company scheme applicable to the employee. The benefit vests upon
completion of five years of continuous service and once vested it is payable to employees on retirement or on termination of employment. In case
of death while in service, the gratuity is payable irrespective of vesting. Some entities makes annual contribution to the group gratuity scheme
administered by the Life Insurance Corporation of India through its Gratuity Trust Fund.
			

Certain overseas subsidiaries also provide for retirement benefits in the nature of pension plans in accordance with the local laws.

		

Post retirement medical

(ii)

		Few entities in the Group provide post retirement medical cover to select grade of employees to cover the retiring employee and their spouse
upto a specified age through mediclaim policy on which the premiums are paid. The eligibility of the employee for the benefit as well as the
amount of medical cover purchased is determined by the grade of the employee at the time of retirement.
		

(iii) Post retirement housing allowance

		The Company operates a post retirement benefit scheme for a certain grade of employees in which a monthly allowance determined on the basis
of the last drawn basic salary at the time of retirement, is paid to the retiring employee in lieu of housing.
(b)
		

Risk exposure
Through its defined benefit plans the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

		(i)

Asset volatility

			The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with references to government bond yields; if plan assets underperform compared
to this yield, this will create or increase a deficit. The defined benefit plans may hold equity type assets, which may carry volatility and
associated risk.
		(ii)

Changes in bond yields

		A decrease in government bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this is expected to be partially offset by an increase in the value of
the plan’s investment in debt instruments.
		(iii) Inflation risk
		The present value of some of the defined benefit plan obligations are calculated with reference to the future salaries of plan participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. The post retirement medical benefit obligation is sensitive
to medical inflation and accordingly, an increase in medical inflation rate would increase the plan’s liability.
		(iv) Life expectancy
			The present value of defined benefit plan obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants, both
during and after the employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

Financial Risk Management Framework
	In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to a certain financial risks namely credit risk, interest risk, currency risk & liquidity risk. The Group’s
primary focus is to achieve better predictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
	The financial risks are managed in accordance with the risk management policy which has been approved by Board of Directors of the respective Group
companies.
	Board of Directors of financial services businesses have established Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO), which is responsible for developing
and monitoring risk management policies for their businesses. The financial services businesses are exposed to high credit risk given the unbanked rural
customer base and diminishing value of collateral. The credit risk is managed through credit norms established based on historical experience.
(a) Market Risk Management
		Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates etc. could affect the Group’s income or the
value of its holdings of financial instruments including cash flow. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk
exposures within acceptable parameters, while maximising the return.

Credit Risk Management

		Credit Risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group usually
deals with creditworthy counterparties and obtain sufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from
defaults. The exposure is continuously monitored.
		(i)

Financial Guarantees

			
In addition, the Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to financial guarantees given to banks. The Group’s maximum exposure in this respect
is the maximum amount the Group could have to pay if the guarantee is called on. The amount recognised in Balance Sheet as liabilities and
maximum exposure details are as given below:

Particulars

		

The financial services business has applied the following estimation technique in its ECL model:

		“Probability of Default” (PD) is an estimate of likelihood or risk of default occurring over a particular time horizon. The measurement of risk of
defaults is computed on homogenous portfolios, generally by nature of loans, tenors, underlying collateral, geographies and borrower profiles. The
default risk is assessed using PD (probability of default) derived from past behavioural trends of default across the identified homogenous portfolios.
These past trends factor in the past customer behavioural trends, credit transition probabilities and macroeconomic conditions. The assessed PDs
are then aligned considering future economic conditions that are determined to have a bearing on ECL.
		

–	Loss given default is calculated based on discounted actual cash flow on past portfolio in default along with reversals.

		Forward Looking Information
		In calculating the expected credit loss rates, the financial services business considers historical loss rates on portfolio over a period which covers
most external factors like drought, government and policy changes etc and these historical PDs are converted into forward looking PDs considering
macro-economic variables like agricultural, GDP/Government consumption related parameters.
Assessment of significant increase in credit risk
		When determining whether the risk of default has increased significantly since initial recognition, the financial services business considers both
quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the business’s historical experience, including forward-looking information. The
financial services business considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost and effort. The
financial services business’s accounting policy is not to use the practical expedient that the financial assets with ‘low’ credit risk at the reporting
date are deemed not to have had a significant increase in credit risk. As a result the financial services business monitors all financial assets and
loan commitments that are subject to impairment for significant increase in credit risk.

		Since financial services business portfolio predominantly includes retail loan portfolio with around 3 million loan accounts making it difficult to
define default at an individual loan account, it has considered 90 days past due as the event of default. The same is also in line with the regulator’s
definition of default of 90 days past due.

		
Inputs considered in the ECL model
		
In assessing the impairment of loans assets under Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Model, the loan assets have been segmented into three stages. The
three stages reflect the general pattern of credit deterioration of a financial instrument. The differences in accounting between stages, relate to
the recognition of expected credit losses and the calculation and presentation of interest revenue.
		The financial services business categorises loan assets (except trade advances) into stages based on the days past due status:
			— Stage 1: 0-30 days past due
			— Stage 2: 31-90 days past due
			— Stage 3: More than 90 days
		The financial services business categorises trade advances into stages primarily based on the days past due status:
			— Stage 1: 0-60 days past due
			— Stage 2: 61-90 days past due
			— Stage 3: More than 90 days
		Assumptions considered in the ECL model
		

430

The financial services business has made the following assumptions in the ECL Model:

		

— “Loss given default” (LGD) is common for all three Stages and is based on loss in past portfolio. Actual cash flows are discounted at loan
EIR rate for arriving loss rate.

		

— “Probability of Default” (PD) is applied on Stage 1 and Stage 2 on portfolio basis and for Stage 3 PD at 100%.

		The financial services business considers a financial asset to be in “default” and therefore Stage 3 (credit impaired) for ECL calculations when the
borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments.

		The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when there is no realistic prospect of further recovery. This is generally the case when
the financial services business determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to
repay the amounts subject to the write- off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities under the
recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.

The fair values of financial services receivables are calculated using a portfolio-based approach, grouping loans as far as possible into
homogenous groups based on similar characteristics. The fair value is then extrapolated to the portfolio using discounted cash flow models
that incorporate interest rate estimates considering all significant characteristics of the loans. This fair value is then reduced by impairment
allowance which is already calculated incorporating probability of defaults and loss given defaults to arrive at fair value net of risk.

46. Segment information
Operating Segments
	The Company is both an operating company, primarily having operations in the Automotive and Farm Equipment segments and a holding company with a
portfolio of investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that operate in segments, like Financial Services, IT services, Real Estate, Hospitality,
Logistics, Defence, Renewables, etc. The operational revenue and results of these investments get reflected in the consolidated results of the Company.
	As part of the group strategy and vision, the Company is focused on operational efficiencies and synergies and driving value creation through partnerships,
mergers and acquisitions in order to generate periodic returns from these portfolio of investments/businesses. The CODM (Chief Operating Decision
Maker) of the Company therefore manages investments/businesses, allocates capital and measures performance under three key verticals, namely
Automotive, Farm Equipment and Services.
	Pursuant to this, the Group from year ended 31st March, 2024 has updated its consolidated segment disclosures and has reported four segments, namely
Automotive, Farm Equipment, Financial Services and Industrial Businesses and Consumer Services. Financial Services is part of the Services vertical
but reported separately as it meets the required quantitative threshold for separate reporting. Industrial Businesses and Consumer Services segment
comprises all other segments that individually do not meet the threshold for separate reporting. Further, the share of profit or loss and investments in
associates and joint ventures are now reported in their respective segments. Description of the each of the reportable segments is as under:
(a) Automotive: This segment comprises of sale of automobiles, two wheelers, spares, construction equipments and related services.
(b) Farm Equipment: This segment comprises of sale of tractors, implements, spares, powerol and related services.
(c)	Financial Services: This segment comprises of offering financial products ranging from retail and other loans, SME finance, housing finance, mutual
funds and life and non-life insurance broking services.
(d)	Industrial Businesses and Consumer Services segment comprises of all other segments like IT services, Real Estate, Hospitality, Logistics, Steel trading
and processing, Renewables, After-market, Defence, Agri, etc. that individually do not meet the reporting thresholds.
	In the consolidated financial statement, the segment related disclosures for comparative year has been reclassified to conform with the presentation and
reporting in the current year.
	Further, in accordance with the above change, the Group has reported the interest and other investment related income pertaining to the aforesaid
segments as ‘Income from Investments related to subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures’ in the consolidated financial statement as applicable.
Similarly, loss pertaining to the aforesaid segments is reported as ‘Loss from Investments related to subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures’. Such
incomes (net) which were reported as ‘Other income’ in comparative year has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Share of profit/
(loss) of associates and joint ventures continue to be presented separately in the consolidated financial statement.
	The measurement of each segment’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities is consistent with the accounting policies that are used in preparation of
the consolidated financial statements. Segment result represents the profit before interest and tax without allocation of corporate income and expenses.
Information regarding the Group’s reportable segments is presented below:

Justification for why the proposed transaction is in the interest of the Company and Rationale for revision of monetary limit to
Rs. 30,500 crores
MEAL was incorporated on 25th October, 2022 to undertake the 4 (Four) Wheel Passenger Electric Vehicles Business of the Company.
Earlier British International Investment Plc (“BII”), the UK’s Development Finance Institution and impact investor and the Company had
entered into a binding agreement to invest up to Rs. 1,925 crores each in MEAL. Till 31st March, 2024, BII has invested Rs 1,200 crores in
MEAL in the form of compulsory convertible instruments and a nominal shareholding of 100 equity shares of MEAL. Jongsong Investments
Pte Ltd (“Temasek”) had executed a binding agreement for investment of Rs. 1,200 crores into MEAL in the form of compulsory convertible
instruments, of which Rs. 300 crores were invested till 31st March, 2024. Both the investments are designed to significantly accelerate the
availability and adoption of electric vehicles in India and other markets served by the Company.
Further, the Company has approved an investment of Rs. 12,000 crores in MEAL to fund its EV journey over the next 3 years. The Company and its
Auto Division expect to generate sufficient operating cash to satisfy all its capital investment needs and are not looking to raise additional capital.
The aforesaid investments would result in BII and Temasek having a shareholding in the range of 2.75% to 4.76% and 1.49% to 2.97%
respectively in MEAL and the shareholding of the Company in MEAL would accordingly get diluted.
The funds infused by the Company, BII and Temasek will be utilized by MEAL primarily to create and market a world-class Electric SUV
portfolio with advanced technologies.
In line with the Company’s commitment to becoming planet-positive by 2040 and its strategic vision to lead the electric vehicle (“EV”)
market, it is anticipated that 20% to 30% of its SUVs will be electric by 2027. This ambitious target will be a key driver in propelling the
Company towards a leadership position in the EV SUV sector. The Company’s efforts will play a crucial role in the decarbonization of the
automotive industry, both in India and globally.
With the strong backing of BII and Temasek, coupled with the Company’s unwavering ambition, it is poised to build a globally desirable brand
that sets new standards in sustainability and innovation.

Nature of relationship with the
Company including nature of its
concern or interest (financial or
otherwise)

Monetary Value

The Company will provide significant support to MEAL in terms of broader manufacturing capabilities, product development, design
organizations, sourcing services along with the ecosystem of suppliers, dealers, and financiers of the Company.

Tenure
The shareholders’ approval will be valid for the period commencing from the Seventy
Eighth Annual General Meeting upto the date of Seventy Ninth Annual General Meeting of
the Company to be held in the year 2025.
Justification for why the proposed MSPL is Mahindra Group's renewable energy platform, which includes one of the leading
transaction is in the interest of the renewable engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") businesses (capacity
Company
constructed of over 4.3 GWp over its tenure of 11+years), an independent power producer
("IPP") business with over 1.60 GWp of solar plants portfolio spread across several states in
India, and plans to have a significant solar development pipeline.
The IPP solar portfolio is spread across 5 key states in India and is backed by long-term power
purchase agreements. Over 95% of assets are backed by central government or equivalent
entities and the remaining with distribution companies backed by state governments. This
portfolio has been sold to Sustainable Energy Infra Trust (“InvIT”), created under MSPL and
its shareholders’ sponsorship. MSPL has won new projects to create pipeline.
As part of the strategic plan to growth, the IPP business in MSPL (along with its shareholders) has
created a business plan to add over 5.5 GWP of Renewable Energy Assets over the next 5 years.
The strategic direction would also be to sell such built assets after holding them for about
1 or 2 years post execution to the InvIT.
These Renewable Energy Assets will be housed in respective subsidiary companies or
Project SPVs (special purpose vehicles). In order to enable these subsidiary companies to
execute these projects, financial and technical support will have to be provided by MSPL.
The financial support will be in the form of promoter contributions, loans and providing
guarantees on behalf of these subsidiary companies. MSPL will also be entering into EPC
and other necessary agreements with these subsidiary companies.
The transactions as stated above are between MSPL and its nine wholly owned subsidiaries.
Keeping in mind the potential quantum of transactions between MSPL and these
subsidiaries as well as probability of future investment in these subsidiaries, it is proposed
to seek approval of the Members for Related Party Transactions entered/to be entered into
between MSPL and the aforementioned subsidiary companies of MSPL.
