Integrated Annual Report - DEAR COMPANIES,
AS A CITIZEN OF
THE FUTURE,
I HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS
FOR YOU.
Will the great things you make,
make the world great too?
Are you planning to make big factories
and bigger forests?
How much proﬁt will the planet make
from your actions?
Would you look a er farmers like
they look a er their crops?
Is helping the less fortunate
a part of your business plans?
Do you agree that a woman is o en
the best man for a job?
When you wake up in the morning,
is it to make the whole world rise?
At Mahindra, we believe questions asked
by the citizens of the future will show the
way to the businesses of the future.
#TogetherWeRise v e. Va l u e s e n d u r e. CHAIRMAN’S
MESSAGE Anand G. Mahindra Chairman “The example set by Keshub Mahindra will now,
more than ever, be a guiding force on how we
tackle the future.” Dear Shareholders,
Mr. Keshub Mahindra was a towering figure
in the Mahindra Group ever since he joined
in and it is difficult to accept that
he is gone. Today, he looms large in our
thoughts. “From a personal
perspective, the
greatest lesson
his life has taught
me is that living
with zest and
engagement is
the secret of a
long, happy and
successful life.” Keshub Mahindra was a part of my life
ever since I was born. There are so many
memories of him I cherish – his charm, his
love for tennis and golf, the dashing picture
he made as he drove the first vehicle to be
indigenously produced by M&M out of the
factory, his knack of instantly connecting
with people, young or old, the affectionate
awe with which he was regarded by the
highest to the lowest in the Mahindra Group.
He died, as he had lived, peacefully,
surrounded by the love of his family. All who
knew him will always regret that he missed
his century by just a few months.
What can we learn from the life of someone
who spent plus impactful years on the planet? Much has been written about
Keshub Mahindra's sagacity, his humility, his
vision and many other qualities of head and
heart – and every word of this is true. But,
from a personal perspective, the greatest
lesson his life has taught me is that living
with zest and engagement is the secret of a
long, happy and successful life. He never
gave in to age or infirmity, remained fully
engaged with the world, till the very end.
And that is why we will miss him every day.
Keshub Mahindra may have retired from
active business when he became NonExecutive Chairman, and later Chairman
Emeritus, but he never retired from life.
Practically till the last day, he continued to
take a lively interest in the affairs of the
Mahindra Group, particularly its social
initiatives. He attended every important
meeting, even during the Covid years, when,
despite being in his nineties, he taught
himself to log in virtually. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - Just a few weeks before he passed away,
he actively participated in the Board
Meeting of the Mahindra United World
College. As late as March, he chaired
meetings of the Board of Trustees of the
Mahindra Foundation and the KC Mahindra
Education Trust. It is inspirational that
despite the weight of his years, he never
slowed down intellectually, never lost his
involvement with the world around him.
It makes me nostalgic when I recall how
keen he always was to keep abreast of
everything that was going on. The progress
of the business was, of course, important
to him. Not a week went by when he would
not ask me for news about the Group's
performance — and the share price!
However, his concern for the business went
hand in hand with his concern for people.
He valued people and their talents. If he got
news of a resignation his first question
always was “But why did this happen? Why
was he or she not happy working with us?”
And his other major area of concern was
technology. As technology became a driving
force in business and our lives, he displayed
an ever-deepening desire to understand and
guide its impact. R&D particularly fascinated
him, and he constantly questioned whether
we were adequately prepared for a world
without fossil fuels. His questioning was
always incisive; yet he never came across as
intimidating or controlling. Empowerment
was very much his style. However, he had
the gift of seeing two moves ahead, and
his questions always made one think.
Having been with M&M almost since
inception, he saw plenty of the ups and
downs of business. He took the rough with
the smooth, with courage. His steady and
clear-headed optimism and his fortitude in
times of adversity was infectious and served
as a beacon for those of us who had the
privilege of working with him. Keshub
Mahindra was an institution, and we will miss
him immensely.
I am sure that your Company's performance
showcased in this Annual Report would have made him very happy. Our core businesses
have had a very good year, despite many
geopolitical and supply side challenges. We
have declared the highest dividend in our
history. M&M shares have outperformed the
Nifty50 as well as the Nifty Auto Index. We
are the best performing stock on Nifty since
. It has clearly been a memorable year.
As for the future, our growth path is clearly
set out. Our strategies for scaling up the
core businesses and the growth gems are
well def ined. The Indian economy has
grown at % and we are in the right place
at the right time.
But there are also tectonic changes in the
offing. The rise of Generative AI is likely to
be a major inflexion point which could
fundamentally transform life and business
as we know it. AI could literally become a
co-pilot in almost everything that we do.
In business, this may well call for totally
reinventing the way we look at our work.
There are exciting times ahead, full of
challenges as well as opportunities.
The example set by Keshub Mahindra will
now, more than ever, be a guiding force
on how we tackle the future.
I pray that all of us in the Mahindra Group
will engage with life and its challenges
with the same foresight , optimism,
unflagging spirit, commitment, passion and
compassion as he did.
That is the best way to ensure that his spirit
will live on. “As technology
became a driving
force in business
and our lives,
Keshub Mahindra
displayed an
ever-deepening
desire to
understand and
guide its impact.” MD & CEO’S
MESSAGE Dr. Anish Shah
MD & CEO “Mr. Keshub Mahindra’s legacy endures in the high
standard of Governance he established, setting a
precedent for companies worldwide. He was truly
a remarkable leader.” Dear Shareholders, “We have seen
a significant
acceleration in

Mr. Keshub Mahindra, bid us farewell in
April of this year. As a visionary leader, he
played a pivotal role in transforming the
Mahindra Group into the diversif ied
powerhouse it is today. His legacy endures
in the high standard of Governance he
established, setting a precedent for
companies worldwide. He was truly a
remarkable leader.
On a personal note, I will miss his mentorship
and guidance, his insights on leadership and
his perspectives on business. He cared
about people and their well-being. He
placed values above everything else, the
importance of keeping our word and
building trust in all our actions.
We are custodians of these values. On November, , the Mahindra Group, then
b a re ly a m o n t h o l d , p u b l i s h e d a n
advertisement in India's largest circulating
English daily. It mentioned no product or
service. Instead, it listed fundamental principles with which the company would
operate. Mr Keshub Mahindra lived these
values. And, our philosophy will remain
steadfast - a commitment to drive positive
change in the lives of our communities,
enabling them to Rise. The refreshed Rise
philosophy is a contemporary expression of
the time-tested values that were written
more than years ago.
Our belief in our Purpose drives our actions.
We continue to play a leadership role in
protecting the Environment by staying on a
bold path to be Planet Positive by and

We have seen a significant acceleration in
the last two years, as our revenue has grown
. times, and our profits have tripled,
outpacing our own ambitious targets.
This financial performance underscores the
robust underlying performance across our
diverse businesses. Our auto business

last four quarters in SUVs and LCVs, while
our tractor business continued to reign
supreme in the market. Our services
businesses have made a signif icant
contribution, with Mahindra Finance well

REPORTS FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS ANNOUNCEMENT
We embarked on our journey of
Integrated Reporting in F17 in keeping
with our commitment towards
transparency and the highest standards
of corporate governance. The following
year, to present our shareholders with a
more holistic view of how we create and
sustain long-term value, we included key
elements of the Integrated Report (IR)
along with the Annual Report. While
staying true to the principles of the
International Integrated Reporting
Council's framework that was
incorporated in the past, our Integrated
Report structure has also evolved to
create a more reader-friendly experience.
This IR is in consonance with SEBI Circular
dated February . An Integrated
Report takes corporate reporting beyond
just discussing the financial resources,
since any value creation activity requires
other resources like people, natural
resources and business relationships.
This report will discuss how Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd. (M&M Ltd.) creates value
by leveraging the interlinkages between
these interdependent resources. Where
necessary, we have explained the concept
using charts and infographics. Some IR
related data might be management
estimates and could be updated in
subsequent publications, like the
Mahindra Sustainability Report.

Integrated Annual Report - HOW TO READ THE REPORT
Integrated Report <IR>
Businesses exist to create value - not only
for the shareholders, but also for their
diverse stakeholders. A business's ability
to sustain value over the long-term
depends on how it manages, leverages
and integrates its tangible and intangible
resources - from financial capital, plant &
machinery, employees, communities,
government licenses and natural
resources; to corporate governance
practices, intellectual knowhow and the
social license to operate.
We use an easy-to-understand diagram to
depict inputs, outputs, and the resulting
outcomes, with respect to various
capitals, that are measured by KPIs. The
structure of this report remains true to
the principles of integrated reporting and
seeks to create a more lucid flow of
information for a crisp and coherent
disclosure. The detailed Statutory
Statements and Financial Reports are also part of this document and are in line
with the requirements of the Companies
Act, (including the rules made
thereunder), Indian Accounting Standards,
Securities and Exchange Board of India
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, and
the applicable Secretarial Standards.
Please note that certain statements in
this report with regard to our future
growth prospects are forward-looking
statements, which involve a number of
risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from
those in such forward-looking statements.
Throughout the report, the terms
'Mahindra', 'Mahindra & Mahindra', 'M&M',
and 'M&M Ltd.' have been used
interchangeably to refer to Mahindra &
Mahindra Limited. Scope of the Report
The reporting period of Mahindra &
Mahindra Limited apropos this Integrated
Report is April, to March,
.
This Integrated Report provides an
overview of the operations and business
development activities of the Company.
It is also aligned to the nine principles
of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs'
National Voluntary Guidelines on the
social, environmental and economic
responsibilities of a business. The scope of this Report is related to
Mahindra & Mahindra Limited, consisting
of the Automotive Sector, Farm
Equipment Sector, Spares Business Unit,
Mahindra Research Valley, Two-Wheeler

We have represented data related to
other group businesses and Companies,

double digit growth across all segments.
Passenger vehicles have reached new
highest ever mark with . million sales

initiatives taken by the Government are
driving higher rural incomes. This includes
higher diversification towards high value
crops and agriculture accelerator fund to
promote technological advancement in

allocation of Government budgets on

likely to benefit commercial demand. Factors that may significantly impact
demand for automobiles in F23 are:
l Supply shortage of semiconductors in first half of F23
l Policies by the Government to boost consumption
l Aggressive Government push for infrastructure-led growth

and ‘Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity’ in the Consolidated Financial Statements
respectively forming part of the Annual Report. The Financial Year was a year of uncertainty, recovery
and economic resilience for India. Even as India looked beyond
the pandemic, elevated uncertainty due to geopolitical tensions
and a war in Ukraine set the tone even before the fiscal year
started. The war resulted in higher global supply-chain-related
disruptions and fuelled global inflationary forces, which seeped
into the domestic consumption basket. Oil breached USD /
barrel of crude oil mark, and industrial metal prices soared in
the first quarter.
Higher inflation forced major central banks to firefight inflation
with an ultra-hawkish policy stance. While the faster-than-normal
pace of monetary policy tightening resulted in the peaking of
inflationary forces, it also raised headwinds to global growth.
A stronger dollar resulting from US Federal Reserve’s policy
tightening and higher commodity prices accentuated external
difficulties for emerging economies including India. The RBI
also hiked rates aggressively to combat domestic inflationary
pressures in line with the global monetary policy cycle.
Global growth lost momentum as monetary policy actions
tightened financial conditions and consumer confidence
weakened with the rising cost of livelihood. Inflation remained
elevated and persistent across countries as they grappled
with food and energy price shocks and shortages. Yet, India’s
economic resilience stands out with the first advance estimates
(FAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), placing
India’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at %
year-on-year (y-o-y) for FY23, driven by private consumption
and investment.

AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT STANDALONE
ACCOUNTS CONSOLIDATED
ACCOUNTS Back home, the sustained focus on capital and infrastructure
spending in the Union Budget - along with continuing
fiscal consolidation and strong credit growth creates space
for private investment and supports domestic economic
activity. However, there are early forecasts of a probable
El Nino and external demand is likely to be dented by
a slowdown in global activity. Taking all these factors
into consideration, the RBI projects real GDP growth for
- at .%. Committee increased the policy repo rate by bps during
May -February taking the policy Repo rate to
.%. RBI also sucked out liquidity from the system with the
system liquidity falling from Rs. . lakh crore in April, to Rs. . lakh crores in March, . Money market rates and
short-term bond yields hardened in tandem with policy rate
increases and tightness in liquidity, while long term bond yields
were largely range-bound. CPI has since eased substantially
and is well within RBI’s medium-term +/- % target. Finance The Indian rupee (INR) depreciated vis-à-vis the US dollar
buffeted by global spillovers. The INR touched an all-time low
of . during October, but has recovered since then
on a depreciating US dollar and net inflows through foreign
portfolio investments. India’s foreign exchange reserves were
placed at US$ . billion as on 31st March, . Financial Year - saw the global outlook deteriorating
markedly as inflation across the world surged to levels
not seen for generations and the rising cost of living hit
consumer confidence. As soaring food and energy prices
threatened to trigger a global crisis, central banks around
the world responded by aggressive monetary tightening and
increased interest rates in the fastest and most synchronized
tightening cycles on record. Due to the aggressive interest
rate hikes, easing of global supply chain bottlenecks and
lower commodity prices, global headline inflation is set to
fall from .% in to .% in (IMF estimates),
however inflation is expected to remain well above central
bank target levels till in most countries.
Record high interest rates and a resurgence of COVID- in
China weighed on global growth during the financial year.
Tentative signs in show that the world economy could
achieve a soft landing. As per International Monetary Fund
(“IMF”), global growth is expected to fall from .% in to .% in with advanced economies expecting to see
an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from .% in to .% in . Side-effects from the fast rise in
policy rates in the form of banking turmoil in the US and
Europe and the accompanying financial stability concerns
weigh on the outlook going forward.
In the currency markets, the US dollar hit a two-decade high with
the dollar index touching in September . The US dollar
has since weakened against most currencies. Volatility impacted
emerging market currencies in an environment of risk aversion,
safe haven demand and correction in global equity markets.
In contrast, domestic financial markets evolved in an orderly
manner. India’s economic activity exhibited resilience with
GDP growth for FY - pegged at %, driven by private
consumption and investment. Consumer price index inflation
(CPI) persisted at elevated levels during the year, impacted
by a series of adverse supply shocks and the continuing
pass-through of high input costs. The RBI Monetary Policy Amidst the aforesaid backdrop, the Bankers continue to rate

Dividend Distribution Policy
The Dividend Distribution Policy (“the policy”) establishes the principles to ascertain amounts that can be distributed to equity
shareholders as dividend by the Company as well as enable the Company strike balance between pay-out and retained earnings,
in order to address future needs of the Company. The policy shall come into force for accounting periods beginning from
1st April, .
Dividend would continue to be declared on per share basis on the Ordinary Equity Shares of the Company having face value
Rs. each. The Company currently has no other class of shares. Therefore, dividend declared will be distributed amongst all
shareholders, based on their shareholding on the record date.
Dividends will generally be recommended by the Board once a year, after the announcement of the full year results and before
the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the shareholders, as may be permitted by the Companies Act. The Board may also declare
interim dividends as may be permitted by the Companies Act.
The Company has had a consistent dividend policy that balances the objective of appropriately rewarding shareholders through
dividends and to support the future growth.
As in the past, subject to the provisions of the applicable law, the Company’s dividend payout will be determined based on
available ﬁnancial resources, investment requirements and taking into account optimal shareholder return. Within these
parameters, the Company would endeavor to maintain a total dividend pay-out ratio in the range of % to % of the annual
standalone Proﬁts after Tax (PAT) of the Company.
While determining the nature and quantum of the dividend payout, including amending the suggested payout range as above,
the Board would take into account the following factors:
● Internal Factors:
i. Profitable growth of the Company and specifically, profits earned during the financial year as compared with: a. Previous years and b. Internal budgets, ii. Cash flow position of the Company, iii. Accumulated reserves, iv. Earnings stability, v. Future cash requirements for organic growth/expansion and/or for inorganic growth, vi. Brand acquisitions,
vii. Current and future leverage and, under exceptional circumstances, the amount of contingent liabilities,
viii. Deployment of funds in short term marketable investments,
ix. Long term investments,
x. Capital expenditure(s), and xi. The ratio of debt to equity (at net debt and gross debt level).
● External Factors:

driven by robust economic growth outlook, focussed Government
policies with vision for , Government focus on road and
infrastructure development, increasing income levels, current low
levels of vehicle penetration, rapid urbanisation and a large, young
and aspiring population.
While the long-term outlook for the Indian auto industry is promising,
there has been some softening of demand for automobiles during
the period between F19 - F23, as compared to the previous ten-year
period of F09 - F19. Exports from India too have been impacted in this
period. Segment CAGR F09-F19 CAGR F19-F23 PV (Domestic Sales) .% .% CV (Domestic Sales) .% -.% Domestic Sales (Excl. 2W) .% .% PV (Export) .% -.% CV (Export) .% .% The softening of demand in the last three years is a result of tapering
of GDP growth, shortage of semiconductors, loss of income due to
COVID- in F20-, increasing cost of ownership due to addition of
multiple safety features and implementation of stricter emission
norms during the last few years.
The Indian auto industry is aware of the need for reducing
dependence on imported oil, improving safety on the roads and most
importantly, the need for clean air. Over the years, the industry has
made significant investments in indigenisation of technologies in the
conventional vehicles space where meeting BS-VI in years is an
example. In F23, the industry has implemented BS6. emission
norms in the country. The Government of India (GOI) has notified
Electric vehicle technology and Hydrogen fuel cell technology as
advanced automotive technology under PLI (Production Linked
Incentive) Scheme. The GOI's ambitious scheme to expedite the
adoption of electric vehicles - Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of
Electric Vehicles in India Phase II (FAME Phase II)-has been extended
by years i.e. up to 31st March, . The Government of India has
announced the PLI (Production
Linked Incentive) Scheme for
AAT (Advance Automotive
Technologies) like battery electric
vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell
vehicles. Furthermore, with the objective of maximising local value addition
and building competitiveness of the Indian industry, the Government
has announced the Phased Manufacturing Plan (PMP). The Indian
auto industry is making the necessary investments and is focused on
building capabilities in the EV space. AUTO INDUSTRY IN FY -
In Financial Year -, the Indian auto industry has shown double
digit growth across all segments. Passenger vehicles have reached
new highest ever mark with . million sales units while commercial
vehicles are still below F19 levels by .%. Indian auto industry sales
(excluding two-wheelers) have recorded highest ever sales of .
million units with .% YoY growth. Partial recovery of Auto Industry was principally a result of: Supply shortage of
semiconductors in
first half of F23. Rural recovery compared
to pre-pandemic still
needs time. As a result, the industry volume of two-wheelers and three-wheelers
are showing slower recovery and are still down by .% and .%
compared to F19 levels.
Over the ten years between F13 and F23, the Utility Vehicle (UV)
segment has witnessed a good growth of .% CAGR. UV, as
share of PV, has increased from .% in F12 to .% in F23.
This growth in UV is driven by increased customer preference for UVstyled vehicles and a shift from compact cars to compact UVs (less
than 4m length). In the last two years (F22 - F23), there were new
launches in the UV segment, and these accounted for % of UV
volume in F22-. For the year F23, compact UVs accounted for %
of UV volume. We believe that electric vehicle
adoption in India would be led by
e-3W; the key drivers being
improving operating economies,
easy deployment for last/ﬁrst mile
connectivity (including at metro
stations) and the growth of startups as 3W aggregators. For the
year F23, a total of , e-3W
were sold, accounting for .% of

remains positive. Over the period F07 to F23, the domestic tractor
industry grew at a CAGR of %. The key growth drivers were
increasing affordability, growing demand for farm mechanisation,
emergence of newer technologies in the farming sector, and
continued focus of Government on improving the state of
agriculture in India. Indian tractor industry with an annual sale of . lakh unit in F23,
recorded its highest ever annual sales. The year saw a growth of

were witnessed with rising crop prices, adequate rainfall in most part

remained buoyant during the peak sowing months, with significant
surge in GoI spending in rural sector during the Rabi sowing months
and continued focus to institutionalise agriculture credit. The year
also witnessed revival in demand from commercial segment which
was tepid during previous year. Increase in allocation of Government budget on infrastructure and
rural development is likely to benefit commercial demand, going
forward. In addition to demand remaining buoyant, supply situation
also eased during F23 as raw material and labour shortage which
affected the industry in the previous years, saw normalisation. Your Company's share in Domestic Tractor Industry

power back-up segment. Other enablers like Financing,
Digitisation and Service Quality. EXPORT FROM INDIA FARM EQUIPMENT SECTOR
For the year under review, your
Company achieved a record of the
highest ever volume and revenue
by exporting , Tractors. This growth can be attributed to higher retails in several markets
where your Company has distribution operations including the USA,
Brazil, Bangladesh, Australia and various African markets like Mali,
Tanzania. The Company has also made significant growth in business
through tenders and bulk orders from markets like Benin, Kenya,
Guyana, etc. Powerol's move towards sustainability has led to the introduction of
the gas-powered gensets with introduction of nodes between
15kVA to 315kVA. They offer lower operating costs and low

In line with the strategy for the two-wheeler business, your Company
through its subsidiary, Classic Legends Private Limited (CLPL) had
reintroduced the iconic brand 'Jawa' to the Indian market in F19, with
the launch of new range of JAWA motorcycles - Jawa and Jawa FortyTwo and strengthening of portfolio by adding Yezdi in F22. During
F23, Bobber was introduced to the Indian market and in addition,
CLPL forayed into international market by introducing iconic British
brand BSA in UK and European market. a result of supply shortage of semiconductors in first half of F23 and
time taken for rural recovery compared to pre-pandemic.
To reduce dependence on oil imports, the industry is exploring
options of alternate fuels like CNG, LNG, Ethanol, etc. The industry is
also exploring options of flex fuel vehicles in the near future. The
industry is also investing in next generation technologies like electric
vehicles and hydrogen.
The Government introduced Production Linked Incentive (PLI)
Scheme for Automobile, Auto Components, ACC (Advanced
Chemistry Cells) and Semiconductors to overcome the cost
disabilities of the industry for manufacture of Advanced Automotive
Technology products in India. The Government has recognised
Electric Vehicle technology and Hydrogen Fuel Cell technology as an
Advanced Automotive Technology in the country. FARM EQUIPMENT SECTOR
To drive sustainable growth in the agriculture sector, strong
Government focus on its development has led to increased adoption
of mechanisation and modern agricultural practices, along with rural
development at large.
However, India, with its large base of small and marginal farmers, has
several regions with low penetration of farm mechanisation. With
increasing labour cost and labour scarcity, greater adoption of
various forms of mechanisation is the way forward. In this scenario,
the market for tractors and other farm equipment is expected to
grow in the long term. ALLIED BUSINESSES OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS The rising demand for power backup solutions and infrastructure
development will create opportunities in the power generation and
infrastructure equipment space. This is an opportunity for the
Company to grow its offerings in power solutions and construction
equipment. AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
Indian automotive industry has been christened as a sunrise sector
and champion industry due to the immense contribution the industry
makes to the Indian economy. The automotive industry's turnover is
.% of India's GDP and % of manufacturing GDP.
In F23, the Indian auto industry has shown double digit growth across
all segments. Passenger vehicles have reached new highest ever
mark with . million sales units while commercial vehicles are still
below F19 levels by .%. Indian auto industry sales (excluding twowheelers) have recorded highest ever sales of . million units with
.% YoY growth. Partial recovery of Auto Industry was principally RISKS AND CONCERNS
AUTOMOTIVE AND
FARM EQUIPMENT SECTORS
The Company's business is exposed to many internal and external
risks and it has consequently put in place robust systems and
processes, along with appropriate review mechanisms to actively
monitor, manage and mitigate these risks. COMPETITIVE INTENSITY
Keeping in mind the high growth potential of the Indian automotive
market, all OEMs, homegrown as well as MNCs, have presence across
all vehicle segments. Today, multinational OEMs are deeply
entrenched in the Indian market with local development centres, a
strong local supplier base and good channel penetration. In the PV
segment, the differentiation between cars and UVs is largely blurred.
The industry has seen shift in demand from cars to UVs. This has led
to more number of launches in UVs compared with cars. In F23, every second
passenger vehicle
sold was utility

after years. With the aim to remain competitive in the market and
sustain its leadership position, your Company continues to invest in
new product development, technology upgradations, increasing
channel reach, while focussing on delivering customer centric
products, services and brand building. TAX REGULATIONS India remains a medium-to-high HP tractor market, with over per
cent of sales coming from the - HP categories. The revised
emission norms - TREM IV applicable only to tractor over HP from
January , have impacted around - per cent of the overall
industry volumes. To meet the challenges associated with TREM IV,
your Company has realigned its product portfolio, through the
launch of new products, along with upgrades of existing ones. NEW REGULATION FOR SAFETY
Concerns over road safety are driving legislation and regulatory
reforms. Any new legislation requires technology development and
incurs costs, in turn impacting vehicle prices. Your Company is geared
up and is confident of meeting any new regulations introduced. NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES
Your Company has a comprehensive programme for development of
new products and technologies which will enable it to remain
competitive in the market, cater to emerging customer expectations
and meet any legislative requirements. Along with Electrification,
your Company is also working on alternate fuels technology. ENVIRONMENT AND ALTERNATE FUELS
With concerns over air quality and the need to reduce dependence on
fossil fuels, the Government is actively pursuing large scale adoption
of EVs, especially for intracity uses in fleet application. Your Company
is a pioneer for Electric Vehicles in India and is actively pursuing
development of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market, products and
technology. Along with Electrification, your Company is also working
on alternate fuels technology. India has traditionally seen tax rate differential between small and
large passenger vehicles. This differential is based on length of the
vehicle, engine size and fuel type. While the flagship products of your
Company attract higher tax rates, your Company has strengthened
the UV product portfolio attracting lower tax rates with products like
XUV300, Bolero Neo, Bolero Power Plus, Thar and KUV100. XUV400
attracts minimum GST among all passenger vehicle categories. NEW EMISSION NORMS
The Company has successfully transitioned to BS6 phase emission
norms across all its portfolio products well in time. In its commitment
to improve fuel efficiency and reduce the overall carbon footprint
(CAFÉ ), the Company has adopted advanced combustion
technologies and right product level electrification strategy.
In India, the emission standards for tractors and construction
equipment are regulated separately from the broader automobile
industry. MONSOON
A normal monsoon is important for both agriculture as well as the
rural economy at large. The tractor business in particular, and the automotive business to
some degree, run the risk of a drop in demand, in case of a significant
variation in the monsoon. In addition, an untimely monsoon and
uneven spread has the potential of adversely impacting the
business. POTENTIAL EL-NINO IMPACT
Going into F24, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in its
long range forecast for the monsoon season predicted South-West
Monsoon (June to September) to be normal at % of the LPA (Long
Period Average).
However, with the concerns of El-Nino there is possibility of either
spatial or temporal distribution disruption.
Nevertheless, given that reservoir levels in May, were %
higher than average, and that there has been excess rainfall in premonsoon months, the potential El-Nino impact is not expected to
cause a major disruption. CAPACITY
In the Automotive Segment, your Company has increased capacity of
SUVs from , in F22 exit to , by end of F23 to cater to
continued robust demand for new launches and clear existing
bookings and reduce waiting period for the new launches.
In the Farm Equipment Sector, your Company has built adequate
manufacturing capacity for the immediate future and is in the
process of investing in additional capacity as part of its mid to longterm strategy. We reached a number of milestones in F23. Mahindra's
Tractor factories in Zaheerabad and Rudrapur produced the
st
st
,, and ,, tractors respectively, while the Rudrapur
th
facility also produced its ,, gearbox. As it prepares to open
its new manufacturing facility in Mohali, Swaraj Tractors produced its
two millionth tractor. A further .% stake of Swaraj Engines
Limited (SEL) was acquired by your Company from Kirloskar
Industries Limited (KIL). As a result, we now own .% of SEL,
making SEL a subsidiary of the Company. During the year, we also
launched our first exclusive farm machinery (non-tractor) plant in
the industrial city of Pithampur, Madhya Pradesh, enabling the
Company to manufacture durable, high-quality, affordable and
accessible 'Made in India, for India' farm machinery, marketed in both
the Mahindra and Swaraj brands. COMMODITY PRICES
Commodity prices in F23 were volatile. In the first quarter, steel
prices rose sharply due to supply concerns caused by Russia-Ukraine
conflict. However, from June onwards, prices softened on
account of easing supply concerns and weak economic outlook due
to interest rate increases by major Central Banks. Additionally, there
was pressure on Indian steel prices due to levy of export duties on
key raw materials and products. Subsequently from December onwards, prices firmed up due to expectations of demand growth
driven by withdrawal of Zero-COVID policy by the Chinese
Government and removal of export duties by the Indian Government.
Your Company stayed focussed on cost reduction through measures
like VA/VE, negotiation with suppliers, long-term price contracting,
etc.
Your Company continues to watch the market situation closely and
continues to focus on mitigating commodity price volatility through
"Commodity Risk Management". Production Milestones

FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESS As per the Automotive Mission
Plan (AMP ), the mid
to long-term outlook for the
Indian auto industry is positive.
Hon'ble Prime Minister unveiled
Indian Auto Industry Vision @ mentioning Auto Industry is the
engine of economic growth. In F23, the Indian auto industry has shown double digit growth across
all segments. Passenger vehicles have reached new highest ever
mark with . million sales units while commercial vehicles are still
below F19 levels by .%. The mid to long-term outlook for the Indian tractor industry is
positive. Several initiatives taken by the Government are driving
higher rural incomes. Examples being higher diversification towards
high value crops, agriculture accelerator fund to promote
technological advancement in agriculture, expansion of non-farm
income opportunities, etc. In addition, increase in allocation of
Government budgets on infrastructure and rural development is
likely to benefit commercial demand. Further, the demand for
mechanisation is also growing as shortage of agricultural labour will
lead to increase in labour cost. Several enabling factors supporting
industry growth, like, institutional credit, consolidation of farm
holdings by FPOs, etc. have shown a positive trend in the last few
years. Increase in leasing of land from % in early 2000s to % in
- and Government subsidy for mechanisation will support
the growth of the sector. An increasing trend of more farmers taking
technical advice in agriculture, also reflects the growth of
progressive farmers.
However, the past trends of the tractor industry depict a picture of
strong cyclicality. Every - years growth in the industry is followed
with a drop or slow-down. On an average, in the last years, industry saw a growth of -% annually and monsoon plays a critical role in
defining the cyclical nature of the industry and therefore remains a
key monitorable. Going into F24, the Indian Meteorological
Department (IMD) in its first long range forecast for the monsoon
season predicted SW Monsoon (June to September) to be normal at
% of the LPA (Long Period Average). However, with the growing
concerns of El-Nino, there is possibility of disruptions either in spatial
or temporal distribution.
Reservoir levels in May, were % higher than average.
Adequate water in reservoirs coupled with excess rainfall in the premonsoon months of March to May supported irrigated lands.
However, the above-normal heat wave days in May, over most
parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, East Uttar
Pradesh, coastal Andhra Pradesh and some parts of North
Chhattisgarh, East Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and coastal Gujarat
caused some disruption in land preparation activity before the Kharif
sowing months. We showcased our audacious vision for the future of electric mobility
with the unveiling of our new state-of-the-art EV platform INGLO and
five new production-ready e-SUVs under two EV brands (Mahindra
Twin Peak and BE).
Your Company is constantly leveraging multiple emerging
technologies, including EVs, digital-enabled platforms and HMI with
software-defined vehicles and is upskilling its product design
engineers in evolving fields of data science, AI, IoT, mechatronics, and
so on, to aid in the development of new products. Mahindra Research
Valley, the flagship R&D and innovation centre has been granted patents, the highest number of patents to any Indian Original
Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM"), from across the globe in the last
six quarters, which is testimony to the cutting-edge work being done
by its diverse and talented workforce. Nevertheless, a normal monsoon outlook and water reservoir level
better than -year average will be positives for the farming sector.
Macroeconomic tailwinds mostly remain intact for the rural
economy, and with likely higher Government support, particularly
with states going for elections, this bodes well for tractor demand. STRATEGY

Digital Learning Initiatives
From F22 onwards, our focus has been to bring world class
digital learning content to our employees across all
management grades. To that effect, we entered into
strategic partnerships with key content partners such as
Udemy, HMM Spark etc. Furthermore, in order to make the
learning experience truly world class, we have also
launched the EdCast by Cornerstone, learning experience
platform for employees across a number of our Group
companies.
Our learning experience platform now consolidates our
various digital learning content providers under a single
umbrella for the learner and by leveraging the power of
artificial intelligence and machine learning, it is able to
provide highly personalised learning content to our
employees across the Group. Furthermore, we have been
able to leverage the platform well beyond standardised elearnings and this has led to both a high adoption rate as
well as learner NPS. In a short period of time, we have seen
approximately % adoption rate and more than million
items of learning consumed. We believe this is a testament
to our skills first approach of capability development and
we anticipate further demand for learning content over
FY24. RE-IMAGINING THE NASHIK CAMPUS
Our Nashik MLU campus is a world class facility built around the
modern learner. With multiple Mahindra plants and offices located in
a km radius of this facility, the campus is generally a beehive of
activity! It is detached from the hustle bustle of the city life and is
surrounded by more than trees, flora and fauna. Yet, because of
our digital first approach to learning, our learners are always
connected to the best learning resources always. On an average, the campus hosts more than , learners each
year. Furthermore, the Nashik campus has world class classroom
facilities and has the ability to host more than learners
simultaneously. While COVID- significantly restricted our use of
the campus, in F22, we also prepared the Nashik campus to welcome
back our learners to our piece of heaven.
Apart from the ongoing maintenance activities, we have now reimagined the entire classroom experience such that it creates a
seamless blended learning experience. Our digital classroom
connects with learners who are sitting in Nashik, Chennai, Mumbai
and/or at home such that the learning experience is not impacted.
This enables us to bring them world class faculty from within our
Group and outside at the touch of a button!
F23, saw a strong 'Back to Classroom' trend and MLU Nashik has
once again regained its prominence as the crown jewel of our
learning infrastructure. We hosted more than , learners over
the course of the year with an average score of . in terms of an incampus experience. FUNCTIONAL TALENT ACCELERATORS
AT MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA
In the Mahindra Group, Talent Management is crucial and critical,
both from a business point of view and from a talent perspective.
Technical talent accelerators are equally important to build a
pipeline of business leaders. The aforesaid initiative has helped to create global sustained
competitiveness and the Technical Ladder that was conceptualised
in MRV is a unique way of differentiating technical talent from
general management in terms of performance management, talent
management and capability building. It puts a high focus on
developing deep technical expertise in various systems of product
development.
The Technical Ladder implementation in Mahindra has been a
response to one of the biggest challenges that the Company has
been facing in Talent Management. The first step of technical ladder
was achieved by creating unique competencies, which combined
technical skills and leadership behaviours. These were deployed in
performance management discussions and capability building
initiatives. Specific development goals are now integrated into
training needs and Learning & Growth Plan (LGP) to facilitate
capability building of niche technical skills through right exposure,
and action learning projects.
The second step of technical ladder was to identify high potential
technical talent and develop them into future Technology Leaders
through a structured intervention. For the developmental journey,
we have tied-up with best-in-class organisations to support in Tech
Leap programme. As a result, today the Tech Ladder
framework is successfully
catering to more than ,
engineers, covering multiple COEs
and Project Functions across the
Automotive and Farm Divisions. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Our performance management system is built on strong principles of
simplicity, accountability, empowerment, and meritocracy. It aligns
the individual efforts and energy with organisational priorities. It
creates a strong merit-based culture that rewards and encourages
outperformance. Leaders and managers are held accountable for
fostering an environment which encourages employees to
demonstrate the right behaviours and deliver outstanding results. In our quest to build a healthy
pipeline of technical talent in
Product Development and the
related associated areas, the
Company set up the Mahindra
Research Valley (MRV), which
serves as a crucible for innovation
and technology for the Auto and
Farm Divisions of the Company. The performance cycle is from 1st April to 31st March with a threestep process of Goal Setting, Mid-Year Review and Annual Appraisal.
Feedback/development conversations between people managers
and direct reports is key at every stage. A key highlight of our
performance system is that we no longer use overall appraisal
ratings. All key decisions (e.g., Promotions, Increments, Rewards, etc.)
are based on the individual's Goal Sheet / Performance Score and
Scores on Leadership Behaviours and discussions amongst the
talent panels appropriately constituted at different levels. Learning
& Growth Plan is a key tool in our performance management system
which aims at developing skills for current and future roles, and for
career growth for employees. The overall objective of the performance management system is to
ensure an alignment between an individual's goals and the
organisation's goals and priorities, thereby enabling conversations at
every step of the process and actions towards enhancing
accountability and providing a base for a focussed career growth.
Lastly, this simple and transparent system aims not just to evaluate
and reward performance but also reinforces and drives the three key
Mahindra Leadership Behaviours of Collaboration, Agility and Bold in turn driving the right culture across. During the year, we have driven leadership perspective sharing
sessions, conscious inclusion workshops, infrastructure correction
across our locations and established ERGs across prominent
locations. We have announced, e-accessibility on our social media
platforms the International Day of People with Disabilities, where all
our posts on social media carry image descriptions and closed
captions. We expect these steps to help us build more inclusive
culture going forward. GROUP MANAGEMENT CADRE (GMC)
The next step of our strategic management process is the Group
Management Cadre programme to attract leadership talent at the
entry-level from top B-Schools of the country. This programme
continues to strengthen Mahindra's position as an 'Employer of
Choice' across premier B-School campuses and creates a strong
talent pool to drive Mahindra's future growth. Through this
programme, GMCs joined the Group in , and GMCs will join
us in across various Sectors and functions. As part of the
Experiential Module, each GMC that joins us undergoes three stints
of months across different functions and businesses. The Summer
Internship Programme has evolved over the years as a critical source
of the GMC talent pool, and this year we have students who have
joined us from the top B-school of India under the GMC Summer
Internship Programme . Our special focus has been to improve gender diversity in areas of
technology and business operations which are also going to be thrust
areas for the Company. Equal Opportunity Policy GROUP DIVERSITY COUNCIL (GDC)

The Group continues its strong focus on fostering Diversity and
Inclusion (D&I) at the workplace with the D&I Vision of - M&M provides equal opportunity to all persons. There is no unfair

potential to create products and
experiences that count for our customers.” We have been working with wider involvement across the
