Integrated Annual Report - Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements | for the year ended 31st March, General information Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (‘the Company’) is a limited company incorporated in India. The address of its registered office and principal activities of the
Company are disclosed in the introduction to the Annual Report. The Ordinary (Equity) shares of the Company are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (“NSE”) and BSE Limited (“BSE”) in India. The
Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) of the Company are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and also admitted for trading on International Order
Book (IOB) of London Stock Exchange. Significant Accounting Policies
a) Statement of compliance and basis of preparation and presentation These consolidated financial statements of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’ or ‘Mahindra Group’) have been prepared
in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended and notified under
Section of the Companies Act, (the ‘Act’) and other relevant provisions of the Act. b) These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 26th May, .
Basis of measurement The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured
at fair values.
c) Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. Subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis from the date the control is
transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for
business combinations by the Group. Changes in the Group’s interest in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted as equity transactions. The carrying amount
of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any
difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is
recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company. In case of loss of control of a subsidiary, the difference of the aggregate of fair value of consideration received and fair value of retained
interest as compared to the carrying amount of the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary and related noncontrolling interest, if any, is recognised as gain or loss in Consolidated statement of profit and loss. Additionally, components of Other
Comprehensive Income of Subsidiaries are reclassified to Consolidated statement of profit and loss or transferred directly to retained earnings.
The fair value of any investment retained at the date when control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial recognition of investment in an associate
or jointly controlled entity or as the fair value on initial recognition of investment classified as a financial asset. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. These financial statements are prepared by applying
uniform accounting policies in use at the Group. Associates Associates are the entities over which the Group has significant influence. Investment in associates are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting, after initially being recognised at cost. Joint arrangements A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have the rights to the net assets of the
arrangement. The results, assets and liabilities of a joint venture are accounted using the equity method of accounting. Where the Group’s activities
are conducted through joint operations (i.e. the parties have rights to the assets and obligation for liabilities relating to the arrangement), the Group
recognises its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses of such joint operations incurred jointly along with its share of income from the sale
of output.
d) Measurement of fair values A number of Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and
liabilities. The Group has established policies and procedures with respect to the measurement of fair values. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: — Level : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. — Level : Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. — Level : Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
