Integrated Annual Report - DEAR COMPANIES,
AS A CITIZEN OF
THE FUTURE,
I HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS
FOR YOU.
Will the great things you make,
make the world great too?
Are you planning to make big factories
and bigger forests?
How much proﬁt will the planet make
from your actions?
Would you look a er farmers like
they look a er their crops?
Is helping the less fortunate
a part of your business plans?
Do you agree that a woman is o en
the best man for a job?
When you wake up in the morning,
is it to make the whole world rise?
At Mahindra, we believe questions asked
by the citizens of the future will show the
way to the businesses of the future.
#TogetherWeRise v e. Va l u e s e n d u r e. CHAIRMAN’S
MESSAGE Anand G. Mahindra Chairman “The example set by Keshub Mahindra will now,
more than ever, be a guiding force on how we
tackle the future.” Dear Shareholders,
Mr. Keshub Mahindra was a towering figure
in the Mahindra Group ever since he joined
in and it is difficult to accept that
he is gone. Today, he looms large in our
thoughts. “From a personal
perspective, the
greatest lesson
his life has taught
me is that living
with zest and
engagement is
the secret of a
long, happy and
successful life.” Keshub Mahindra was a part of my life
ever since I was born. There are so many
memories of him I cherish – his charm, his
love for tennis and golf, the dashing picture
he made as he drove the first vehicle to be
indigenously produced by M&M out of the
factory, his knack of instantly connecting
with people, young or old, the affectionate
awe with which he was regarded by the
highest to the lowest in the Mahindra Group.
He died, as he had lived, peacefully,
surrounded by the love of his family. All who
knew him will always regret that he missed
his century by just a few months.
What can we learn from the life of someone
who spent plus impactful years on the planet? Much has been written about
Keshub Mahindra's sagacity, his humility, his
vision and many other qualities of head and
heart – and every word of this is true. But,
from a personal perspective, the greatest
lesson his life has taught me is that living
with zest and engagement is the secret of a
long, happy and successful life. He never
gave in to age or infirmity, remained fully
engaged with the world, till the very end.
And that is why we will miss him every day.
Keshub Mahindra may have retired from
active business when he became NonExecutive Chairman, and later Chairman
Emeritus, but he never retired from life.
Practically till the last day, he continued to
take a lively interest in the affairs of the
Mahindra Group, particularly its social
initiatives. He attended every important
meeting, even during the Covid years, when,
despite being in his nineties, he taught
himself to log in virtually. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - Just a few weeks before he passed away,
he actively participated in the Board
Meeting of the Mahindra United World
College. As late as March, he chaired
meetings of the Board of Trustees of the
Mahindra Foundation and the KC Mahindra
Education Trust. It is inspirational that
despite the weight of his years, he never
slowed down intellectually, never lost his
involvement with the world around him.
It makes me nostalgic when I recall how
keen he always was to keep abreast of
everything that was going on. The progress
of the business was, of course, important
to him. Not a week went by when he would
not ask me for news about the Group's
performance — and the share price!
However, his concern for the business went
hand in hand with his concern for people.
He valued people and their talents. If he got
news of a resignation his first question
always was “But why did this happen? Why
was he or she not happy working with us?”
And his other major area of concern was
technology. As technology became a driving
force in business and our lives, he displayed
an ever-deepening desire to understand and
guide its impact. R&D particularly fascinated
him, and he constantly questioned whether
we were adequately prepared for a world
without fossil fuels. His questioning was
always incisive; yet he never came across as
intimidating or controlling. Empowerment
was very much his style. However, he had
the gift of seeing two moves ahead, and
his questions always made one think.
Having been with M&M almost since
inception, he saw plenty of the ups and
downs of business. He took the rough with
the smooth, with courage. His steady and
clear-headed optimism and his fortitude in
times of adversity was infectious and served
as a beacon for those of us who had the
privilege of working with him. Keshub
Mahindra was an institution, and we will miss
him immensely.
I am sure that your Company's performance
showcased in this Annual Report would have made him very happy. Our core businesses
have had a very good year, despite many
geopolitical and supply side challenges. We
have declared the highest dividend in our
history. M&M shares have outperformed the
Nifty50 as well as the Nifty Auto Index. We
are the best performing stock on Nifty since
. It has clearly been a memorable year.
As for the future, our growth path is clearly
set out. Our strategies for scaling up the
core businesses and the growth gems are
well def ined. The Indian economy has
grown at % and we are in the right place
at the right time.
But there are also tectonic changes in the
offing. The rise of Generative AI is likely to
be a major inflexion point which could
fundamentally transform life and business
as we know it. AI could literally become a
co-pilot in almost everything that we do.
In business, this may well call for totally
reinventing the way we look at our work.
There are exciting times ahead, full of
challenges as well as opportunities.
The example set by Keshub Mahindra will
now, more than ever, be a guiding force
on how we tackle the future.
I pray that all of us in the Mahindra Group
will engage with life and its challenges
with the same foresight , optimism,
unflagging spirit, commitment, passion and
compassion as he did.
That is the best way to ensure that his spirit
will live on. “As technology
became a driving
force in business
and our lives,
Keshub Mahindra
displayed an
ever-deepening
desire to
understand and
guide its impact.” MD & CEO’S
MESSAGE Dr. Anish Shah
MD & CEO “Mr. Keshub Mahindra’s legacy endures in the high
standard of Governance he established, setting a
precedent for companies worldwide. He was truly
a remarkable leader.” Dear Shareholders, “We have seen
a significant
acceleration in

Mr. Keshub Mahindra, bid us farewell in
April of this year. As a visionary leader, he
played a pivotal role in transforming the
Mahindra Group into the diversif ied
powerhouse it is today. His legacy endures
in the high standard of Governance he
established, setting a precedent for
companies worldwide. He was truly a
remarkable leader.
On a personal note, I will miss his mentorship
and guidance, his insights on leadership and
his perspectives on business. He cared
about people and their well-being. He
placed values above everything else, the
importance of keeping our word and
building trust in all our actions.
We are custodians of these values. On November, , the Mahindra Group, then
b a re ly a m o n t h o l d , p u b l i s h e d a n
advertisement in India's largest circulating
English daily. It mentioned no product or
service. Instead, it listed fundamental principles with which the company would
operate. Mr Keshub Mahindra lived these
values. And, our philosophy will remain
steadfast - a commitment to drive positive
change in the lives of our communities,
enabling them to Rise. The refreshed Rise
philosophy is a contemporary expression of
the time-tested values that were written
more than years ago.
Our belief in our Purpose drives our actions.
We continue to play a leadership role in
protecting the Environment by staying on a
bold path to be Planet Positive by and

We have seen a significant acceleration in
the last two years, as our revenue has grown
. times, and our profits have tripled,
outpacing our own ambitious targets.
This financial performance underscores the
robust underlying performance across our
diverse businesses. Our auto business

last four quarters in SUVs and LCVs, while
our tractor business continued to reign
supreme in the market. Our services
businesses have made a signif icant
contribution, with Mahindra Finance well

REPORTS FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS ANNOUNCEMENT
We embarked on our journey of
Integrated Reporting in F17 in keeping
with our commitment towards
transparency and the highest standards
of corporate governance. The following
year, to present our shareholders with a
more holistic view of how we create and
sustain long-term value, we included key
elements of the Integrated Report (IR)
along with the Annual Report. While
staying true to the principles of the
International Integrated Reporting
Council's framework that was
incorporated in the past, our Integrated
Report structure has also evolved to
create a more reader-friendly experience.
This IR is in consonance with SEBI Circular
dated February . An Integrated
Report takes corporate reporting beyond
just discussing the financial resources,
since any value creation activity requires
other resources like people, natural
resources and business relationships.
This report will discuss how Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd. (M&M Ltd.) creates value
by leveraging the interlinkages between
these interdependent resources. Where
necessary, we have explained the concept
using charts and infographics. Some IR
related data might be management
estimates and could be updated in
subsequent publications, like the
Mahindra Sustainability Report.

Integrated Annual Report - HOW TO READ THE REPORT
Integrated Report <IR>
Businesses exist to create value - not only
for the shareholders, but also for their
diverse stakeholders. A business's ability
to sustain value over the long-term
depends on how it manages, leverages
and integrates its tangible and intangible
resources - from financial capital, plant &
machinery, employees, communities,
government licenses and natural
resources; to corporate governance
practices, intellectual knowhow and the
social license to operate.
We use an easy-to-understand diagram to
depict inputs, outputs, and the resulting
outcomes, with respect to various
capitals, that are measured by KPIs. The
structure of this report remains true to
the principles of integrated reporting and
seeks to create a more lucid flow of
information for a crisp and coherent
disclosure. The detailed Statutory
Statements and Financial Reports are also part of this document and are in line
with the requirements of the Companies
Act, (including the rules made
thereunder), Indian Accounting Standards,
Securities and Exchange Board of India
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, and
the applicable Secretarial Standards.
Please note that certain statements in
this report with regard to our future
growth prospects are forward-looking
statements, which involve a number of
risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from
those in such forward-looking statements.
Throughout the report, the terms
'Mahindra', 'Mahindra & Mahindra', 'M&M',
and 'M&M Ltd.' have been used
interchangeably to refer to Mahindra &
Mahindra Limited. Scope of the Report
The reporting period of Mahindra &
Mahindra Limited apropos this Integrated
Report is April, to March,
.
This Integrated Report provides an
overview of the operations and business
development activities of the Company.
It is also aligned to the nine principles
of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs'
National Voluntary Guidelines on the
social, environmental and economic
responsibilities of a business. The scope of this Report is related to
Mahindra & Mahindra Limited, consisting
of the Automotive Sector, Farm
Equipment Sector, Spares Business Unit,
Mahindra Research Valley, Two-Wheeler

We have represented data related to
other group businesses and Companies,

double digit growth across all segments.
Passenger vehicles have reached new
highest ever mark with . million sales

initiatives taken by the Government are
driving higher rural incomes. This includes
higher diversification towards high value
crops and agriculture accelerator fund to
promote technological advancement in

allocation of Government budgets on

likely to benefit commercial demand. Factors that may significantly impact
demand for automobiles in F23 are:
l Supply shortage of semiconductors in first half of F23
l Policies by the Government to boost consumption
l Aggressive Government push for infrastructure-led growth

and ‘Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity’ in the Consolidated Financial Statements
respectively forming part of the Annual Report. The Financial Year was a year of uncertainty, recovery
and economic resilience for India. Even as India looked beyond
the pandemic, elevated uncertainty due to geopolitical tensions
and a war in Ukraine set the tone even before the fiscal year
started. The war resulted in higher global supply-chain-related
disruptions and fuelled global inflationary forces, which seeped
into the domestic consumption basket. Oil breached USD /
barrel of crude oil mark, and industrial metal prices soared in
the first quarter.
Higher inflation forced major central banks to firefight inflation
with an ultra-hawkish policy stance. While the faster-than-normal
pace of monetary policy tightening resulted in the peaking of
inflationary forces, it also raised headwinds to global growth.
A stronger dollar resulting from US Federal Reserve’s policy
tightening and higher commodity prices accentuated external
difficulties for emerging economies including India. The RBI
also hiked rates aggressively to combat domestic inflationary
pressures in line with the global monetary policy cycle.
Global growth lost momentum as monetary policy actions
tightened financial conditions and consumer confidence
weakened with the rising cost of livelihood. Inflation remained
elevated and persistent across countries as they grappled
with food and energy price shocks and shortages. Yet, India’s
economic resilience stands out with the first advance estimates
(FAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), placing
India’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at %
year-on-year (y-o-y) for FY23, driven by private consumption
and investment.

AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT STANDALONE
ACCOUNTS CONSOLIDATED
ACCOUNTS Back home, the sustained focus on capital and infrastructure
spending in the Union Budget - along with continuing
fiscal consolidation and strong credit growth creates space
for private investment and supports domestic economic
activity. However, there are early forecasts of a probable
El Nino and external demand is likely to be dented by
a slowdown in global activity. Taking all these factors
into consideration, the RBI projects real GDP growth for
- at .%. Committee increased the policy repo rate by bps during
May -February taking the policy Repo rate to
.%. RBI also sucked out liquidity from the system with the
system liquidity falling from Rs. . lakh crore in April, to Rs. . lakh crores in March, . Money market rates and
short-term bond yields hardened in tandem with policy rate
increases and tightness in liquidity, while long term bond yields
were largely range-bound. CPI has since eased substantially
and is well within RBI’s medium-term +/- % target. Finance The Indian rupee (INR) depreciated vis-à-vis the US dollar
buffeted by global spillovers. The INR touched an all-time low
of . during October, but has recovered since then
on a depreciating US dollar and net inflows through foreign
portfolio investments. India’s foreign exchange reserves were
placed at US$ . billion as on 31st March, . Financial Year - saw the global outlook deteriorating
markedly as inflation across the world surged to levels
not seen for generations and the rising cost of living hit
consumer confidence. As soaring food and energy prices
threatened to trigger a global crisis, central banks around
the world responded by aggressive monetary tightening and
increased interest rates in the fastest and most synchronized
tightening cycles on record. Due to the aggressive interest
rate hikes, easing of global supply chain bottlenecks and
lower commodity prices, global headline inflation is set to
fall from .% in to .% in (IMF estimates),
however inflation is expected to remain well above central
bank target levels till in most countries.
Record high interest rates and a resurgence of COVID- in
China weighed on global growth during the financial year.
Tentative signs in show that the world economy could
achieve a soft landing. As per International Monetary Fund
(“IMF”), global growth is expected to fall from .% in to .% in with advanced economies expecting to see
an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from .% in to .% in . Side-effects from the fast rise in
policy rates in the form of banking turmoil in the US and
Europe and the accompanying financial stability concerns
weigh on the outlook going forward.
In the currency markets, the US dollar hit a two-decade high with
the dollar index touching in September . The US dollar
has since weakened against most currencies. Volatility impacted
emerging market currencies in an environment of risk aversion,
safe haven demand and correction in global equity markets.
In contrast, domestic financial markets evolved in an orderly
manner. India’s economic activity exhibited resilience with
GDP growth for FY - pegged at %, driven by private
consumption and investment. Consumer price index inflation
(CPI) persisted at elevated levels during the year, impacted
by a series of adverse supply shocks and the continuing
pass-through of high input costs. The RBI Monetary Policy Amidst the aforesaid backdrop, the Bankers continue to rate

Dividend Distribution Policy
The Dividend Distribution Policy (“the policy”) establishes the principles to ascertain amounts that can be distributed to equity
shareholders as dividend by the Company as well as enable the Company strike balance between pay-out and retained earnings,
in order to address future needs of the Company. The policy shall come into force for accounting periods beginning from
1st April, .
Dividend would continue to be declared on per share basis on the Ordinary Equity Shares of the Company having face value
Rs. each. The Company currently has no other class of shares. Therefore, dividend declared will be distributed amongst all
shareholders, based on their shareholding on the record date.
Dividends will generally be recommended by the Board once a year, after the announcement of the full year results and before
the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the shareholders, as may be permitted by the Companies Act. The Board may also declare
interim dividends as may be permitted by the Companies Act.
The Company has had a consistent dividend policy that balances the objective of appropriately rewarding shareholders through
dividends and to support the future growth.
As in the past, subject to the provisions of the applicable law, the Company’s dividend payout will be determined based on
available ﬁnancial resources, investment requirements and taking into account optimal shareholder return. Within these
parameters, the Company would endeavor to maintain a total dividend pay-out ratio in the range of % to % of the annual
standalone Proﬁts after Tax (PAT) of the Company.
While determining the nature and quantum of the dividend payout, including amending the suggested payout range as above,
the Board would take into account the following factors:
● Internal Factors:
i. Profitable growth of the Company and specifically, profits earned during the financial year as compared with: a. Previous years and b. Internal budgets, ii. Cash flow position of the Company, iii. Accumulated reserves, iv. Earnings stability, v. Future cash requirements for organic growth/expansion and/or for inorganic growth, vi. Brand acquisitions,
vii. Current and future leverage and, under exceptional circumstances, the amount of contingent liabilities,
viii. Deployment of funds in short term marketable investments,
ix. Long term investments,
x. Capital expenditure(s), and xi. The ratio of debt to equity (at net debt and gross debt level).
● External Factors:

driven by robust economic growth outlook, focussed Government
policies with vision for , Government focus on road and
infrastructure development, increasing income levels, current low
levels of vehicle penetration, rapid urbanisation and a large, young
and aspiring population.
While the long-term outlook for the Indian auto industry is promising,
there has been some softening of demand for automobiles during
the period between F19 - F23, as compared to the previous ten-year
period of F09 - F19. Exports from India too have been impacted in this
period. Segment CAGR F09-F19 CAGR F19-F23 PV (Domestic Sales) .% .% CV (Domestic Sales) .% -.% Domestic Sales (Excl. 2W) .% .% PV (Export) .% -.% CV (Export) .% .% The softening of demand in the last three years is a result of tapering
of GDP growth, shortage of semiconductors, loss of income due to
COVID- in F20-, increasing cost of ownership due to addition of
multiple safety features and implementation of stricter emission
norms during the last few years.
The Indian auto industry is aware of the need for reducing
dependence on imported oil, improving safety on the roads and most
importantly, the need for clean air. Over the years, the industry has
made significant investments in indigenisation of technologies in the
conventional vehicles space where meeting BS-VI in years is an
example. In F23, the industry has implemented BS6. emission
norms in the country. The Government of India (GOI) has notified
Electric vehicle technology and Hydrogen fuel cell technology as
advanced automotive technology under PLI (Production Linked
Incentive) Scheme. The GOI's ambitious scheme to expedite the
adoption of electric vehicles - Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of
Electric Vehicles in India Phase II (FAME Phase II)-has been extended
by years i.e. up to 31st March, . The Government of India has
announced the PLI (Production
Linked Incentive) Scheme for
AAT (Advance Automotive
Technologies) like battery electric
vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell
vehicles. Furthermore, with the objective of maximising local value addition
and building competitiveness of the Indian industry, the Government
has announced the Phased Manufacturing Plan (PMP). The Indian
auto industry is making the necessary investments and is focused on
building capabilities in the EV space. AUTO INDUSTRY IN FY -
In Financial Year -, the Indian auto industry has shown double
digit growth across all segments. Passenger vehicles have reached
new highest ever mark with . million sales units while commercial
vehicles are still below F19 levels by .%. Indian auto industry sales
(excluding two-wheelers) have recorded highest ever sales of .
million units with .% YoY growth. Partial recovery of Auto Industry was principally a result of: Supply shortage of
semiconductors in
first half of F23. Rural recovery compared
to pre-pandemic still
needs time. As a result, the industry volume of two-wheelers and three-wheelers
are showing slower recovery and are still down by .% and .%
compared to F19 levels.
Over the ten years between F13 and F23, the Utility Vehicle (UV)
segment has witnessed a good growth of .% CAGR. UV, as
share of PV, has increased from .% in F12 to .% in F23.
This growth in UV is driven by increased customer preference for UVstyled vehicles and a shift from compact cars to compact UVs (less
than 4m length). In the last two years (F22 - F23), there were new
launches in the UV segment, and these accounted for % of UV
volume in F22-. For the year F23, compact UVs accounted for %
of UV volume. We believe that electric vehicle
adoption in India would be led by
e-3W; the key drivers being
improving operating economies,
easy deployment for last/ﬁrst mile
connectivity (including at metro
stations) and the growth of startups as 3W aggregators. For the
year F23, a total of , e-3W
were sold, accounting for .% of

remains positive. Over the period F07 to F23, the domestic tractor
industry grew at a CAGR of %. The key growth drivers were
increasing affordability, growing demand for farm mechanisation,
emergence of newer technologies in the farming sector, and
continued focus of Government on improving the state of
agriculture in India. Indian tractor industry with an annual sale of . lakh unit in F23,
recorded its highest ever annual sales. The year saw a growth of

were witnessed with rising crop prices, adequate rainfall in most part

remained buoyant during the peak sowing months, with significant
surge in GoI spending in rural sector during the Rabi sowing months
and continued focus to institutionalise agriculture credit. The year
also witnessed revival in demand from commercial segment which
was tepid during previous year. Increase in allocation of Government budget on infrastructure and
rural development is likely to benefit commercial demand, going
forward. In addition to demand remaining buoyant, supply situation
also eased during F23 as raw material and labour shortage which
affected the industry in the previous years, saw normalisation. Your Company's share in Domestic Tractor Industry

power back-up segment. Other enablers like Financing,
Digitisation and Service Quality. EXPORT FROM INDIA FARM EQUIPMENT SECTOR
For the year under review, your
Company achieved a record of the
highest ever volume and revenue
by exporting , Tractors. This growth can be attributed to higher retails in several markets
where your Company has distribution operations including the USA,
Brazil, Bangladesh, Australia and various African markets like Mali,
Tanzania. The Company has also made significant growth in business
through tenders and bulk orders from markets like Benin, Kenya,
Guyana, etc. Powerol's move towards sustainability has led to the introduction of
the gas-powered gensets with introduction of nodes between
15kVA to 315kVA. They offer lower operating costs and low

In line with the strategy for the two-wheeler business, your Company
through its subsidiary, Classic Legends Private Limited (CLPL) had
reintroduced the iconic brand 'Jawa' to the Indian market in F19, with
the launch of new range of JAWA motorcycles - Jawa and Jawa FortyTwo and strengthening of portfolio by adding Yezdi in F22. During
F23, Bobber was introduced to the Indian market and in addition,
CLPL forayed into international market by introducing iconic British
brand BSA in UK and European market. a result of supply shortage of semiconductors in first half of F23 and
time taken for rural recovery compared to pre-pandemic.
To reduce dependence on oil imports, the industry is exploring
options of alternate fuels like CNG, LNG, Ethanol, etc. The industry is
also exploring options of flex fuel vehicles in the near future. The
industry is also investing in next generation technologies like electric
vehicles and hydrogen.
The Government introduced Production Linked Incentive (PLI)
Scheme for Automobile, Auto Components, ACC (Advanced
Chemistry Cells) and Semiconductors to overcome the cost
disabilities of the industry for manufacture of Advanced Automotive
Technology products in India. The Government has recognised
Electric Vehicle technology and Hydrogen Fuel Cell technology as an
Advanced Automotive Technology in the country. FARM EQUIPMENT SECTOR
To drive sustainable growth in the agriculture sector, strong
Government focus on its development has led to increased adoption
of mechanisation and modern agricultural practices, along with rural
development at large.
However, India, with its large base of small and marginal farmers, has
several regions with low penetration of farm mechanisation. With
increasing labour cost and labour scarcity, greater adoption of
various forms of mechanisation is the way forward. In this scenario,
the market for tractors and other farm equipment is expected to
grow in the long term. ALLIED BUSINESSES OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS The rising demand for power backup solutions and infrastructure
development will create opportunities in the power generation and
infrastructure equipment space. This is an opportunity for the
Company to grow its offerings in power solutions and construction
equipment. AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR
Indian automotive industry has been christened as a sunrise sector
and champion industry due to the immense contribution the industry
makes to the Indian economy. The automotive industry's turnover is
.% of India's GDP and % of manufacturing GDP.
In F23, the Indian auto industry has shown double digit growth across
all segments. Passenger vehicles have reached new highest ever
mark with . million sales units while commercial vehicles are still
below F19 levels by .%. Indian auto industry sales (excluding twowheelers) have recorded highest ever sales of . million units with
.% YoY growth. Partial recovery of Auto Industry was principally RISKS AND CONCERNS
AUTOMOTIVE AND
FARM EQUIPMENT SECTORS
The Company's business is exposed to many internal and external
risks and it has consequently put in place robust systems and
processes, along with appropriate review mechanisms to actively
monitor, manage and mitigate these risks. COMPETITIVE INTENSITY
Keeping in mind the high growth potential of the Indian automotive
market, all OEMs, homegrown as well as MNCs, have presence across
all vehicle segments. Today, multinational OEMs are deeply
entrenched in the Indian market with local development centres, a
strong local supplier base and good channel penetration. In the PV
segment, the differentiation between cars and UVs is largely blurred.
The industry has seen shift in demand from cars to UVs. This has led
to more number of launches in UVs compared with cars. In F23, every second
passenger vehicle
sold was utility

after years. With the aim to remain competitive in the market and
sustain its leadership position, your Company continues to invest in
new product development, technology upgradations, increasing
channel reach, while focussing on delivering customer centric
products, services and brand building. TAX REGULATIONS India remains a medium-to-high HP tractor market, with over per
cent of sales coming from the - HP categories. The revised
emission norms - TREM IV applicable only to tractor over HP from
January , have impacted around - per cent of the overall
industry volumes. To meet the challenges associated with TREM IV,
your Company has realigned its product portfolio, through the
launch of new products, along with upgrades of existing ones. NEW REGULATION FOR SAFETY
Concerns over road safety are driving legislation and regulatory
reforms. Any new legislation requires technology development and
incurs costs, in turn impacting vehicle prices. Your Company is geared
up and is confident of meeting any new regulations introduced. NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES
Your Company has a comprehensive programme for development of
new products and technologies which will enable it to remain
competitive in the market, cater to emerging customer expectations
and meet any legislative requirements. Along with Electrification,
your Company is also working on alternate fuels technology. ENVIRONMENT AND ALTERNATE FUELS
With concerns over air quality and the need to reduce dependence on
fossil fuels, the Government is actively pursuing large scale adoption
of EVs, especially for intracity uses in fleet application. Your Company
is a pioneer for Electric Vehicles in India and is actively pursuing
development of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market, products and
technology. Along with Electrification, your Company is also working
on alternate fuels technology. India has traditionally seen tax rate differential between small and
large passenger vehicles. This differential is based on length of the
vehicle, engine size and fuel type. While the flagship products of your
Company attract higher tax rates, your Company has strengthened
the UV product portfolio attracting lower tax rates with products like
XUV300, Bolero Neo, Bolero Power Plus, Thar and KUV100. XUV400
attracts minimum GST among all passenger vehicle categories. NEW EMISSION NORMS
The Company has successfully transitioned to BS6 phase emission
norms across all its portfolio products well in time. In its commitment
to improve fuel efficiency and reduce the overall carbon footprint
(CAFÉ ), the Company has adopted advanced combustion
technologies and right product level electrification strategy.
In India, the emission standards for tractors and construction
equipment are regulated separately from the broader automobile
industry. MONSOON
A normal monsoon is important for both agriculture as well as the
rural economy at large. The tractor business in particular, and the automotive business to
some degree, run the risk of a drop in demand, in case of a significant
variation in the monsoon. In addition, an untimely monsoon and
uneven spread has the potential of adversely impacting the
business. POTENTIAL EL-NINO IMPACT
Going into F24, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in its
long range forecast for the monsoon season predicted South-West
Monsoon (June to September) to be normal at % of the LPA (Long
Period Average).
However, with the concerns of El-Nino there is possibility of either
spatial or temporal distribution disruption.
Nevertheless, given that reservoir levels in May, were %
higher than average, and that there has been excess rainfall in premonsoon months, the potential El-Nino impact is not expected to
cause a major disruption. CAPACITY
In the Automotive Segment, your Company has increased capacity of
SUVs from , in F22 exit to , by end of F23 to cater to
continued robust demand for new launches and clear existing
bookings and reduce waiting period for the new launches.
In the Farm Equipment Sector, your Company has built adequate
manufacturing capacity for the immediate future and is in the
process of investing in additional capacity as part of its mid to longterm strategy. We reached a number of milestones in F23. Mahindra's
Tractor factories in Zaheerabad and Rudrapur produced the
st
st
,, and ,, tractors respectively, while the Rudrapur
th
facility also produced its ,, gearbox. As it prepares to open
its new manufacturing facility in Mohali, Swaraj Tractors produced its
two millionth tractor. A further .% stake of Swaraj Engines
Limited (SEL) was acquired by your Company from Kirloskar
Industries Limited (KIL). As a result, we now own .% of SEL,
making SEL a subsidiary of the Company. During the year, we also
launched our first exclusive farm machinery (non-tractor) plant in
the industrial city of Pithampur, Madhya Pradesh, enabling the
Company to manufacture durable, high-quality, affordable and
accessible 'Made in India, for India' farm machinery, marketed in both
the Mahindra and Swaraj brands. COMMODITY PRICES
Commodity prices in F23 were volatile. In the first quarter, steel
prices rose sharply due to supply concerns caused by Russia-Ukraine
conflict. However, from June onwards, prices softened on
account of easing supply concerns and weak economic outlook due
to interest rate increases by major Central Banks. Additionally, there
was pressure on Indian steel prices due to levy of export duties on
key raw materials and products. Subsequently from December onwards, prices firmed up due to expectations of demand growth
driven by withdrawal of Zero-COVID policy by the Chinese
Government and removal of export duties by the Indian Government.
Your Company stayed focussed on cost reduction through measures
like VA/VE, negotiation with suppliers, long-term price contracting,
etc.
Your Company continues to watch the market situation closely and
continues to focus on mitigating commodity price volatility through
"Commodity Risk Management". Production Milestones

FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESS As per the Automotive Mission
Plan (AMP ), the mid
to long-term outlook for the
Indian auto industry is positive.
Hon'ble Prime Minister unveiled
Indian Auto Industry Vision @ mentioning Auto Industry is the
engine of economic growth. In F23, the Indian auto industry has shown double digit growth across
all segments. Passenger vehicles have reached new highest ever
mark with . million sales units while commercial vehicles are still
below F19 levels by .%. The mid to long-term outlook for the Indian tractor industry is
positive. Several initiatives taken by the Government are driving
higher rural incomes. Examples being higher diversification towards
high value crops, agriculture accelerator fund to promote
technological advancement in agriculture, expansion of non-farm
income opportunities, etc. In addition, increase in allocation of
Government budgets on infrastructure and rural development is
likely to benefit commercial demand. Further, the demand for
mechanisation is also growing as shortage of agricultural labour will
lead to increase in labour cost. Several enabling factors supporting
industry growth, like, institutional credit, consolidation of farm
holdings by FPOs, etc. have shown a positive trend in the last few
years. Increase in leasing of land from % in early 2000s to % in
- and Government subsidy for mechanisation will support
the growth of the sector. An increasing trend of more farmers taking
technical advice in agriculture, also reflects the growth of
progressive farmers.
However, the past trends of the tractor industry depict a picture of
strong cyclicality. Every - years growth in the industry is followed
with a drop or slow-down. On an average, in the last years, industry saw a growth of -% annually and monsoon plays a critical role in
defining the cyclical nature of the industry and therefore remains a
key monitorable. Going into F24, the Indian Meteorological
Department (IMD) in its first long range forecast for the monsoon
season predicted SW Monsoon (June to September) to be normal at
% of the LPA (Long Period Average). However, with the growing
concerns of El-Nino, there is possibility of disruptions either in spatial
or temporal distribution.
Reservoir levels in May, were % higher than average.
Adequate water in reservoirs coupled with excess rainfall in the premonsoon months of March to May supported irrigated lands.
However, the above-normal heat wave days in May, over most
parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, East Uttar
Pradesh, coastal Andhra Pradesh and some parts of North
Chhattisgarh, East Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and coastal Gujarat
caused some disruption in land preparation activity before the Kharif
sowing months. We showcased our audacious vision for the future of electric mobility
with the unveiling of our new state-of-the-art EV platform INGLO and
five new production-ready e-SUVs under two EV brands (Mahindra
Twin Peak and BE).
Your Company is constantly leveraging multiple emerging
technologies, including EVs, digital-enabled platforms and HMI with
software-defined vehicles and is upskilling its product design
engineers in evolving fields of data science, AI, IoT, mechatronics, and
so on, to aid in the development of new products. Mahindra Research
Valley, the flagship R&D and innovation centre has been granted patents, the highest number of patents to any Indian Original
Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM"), from across the globe in the last
six quarters, which is testimony to the cutting-edge work being done
by its diverse and talented workforce. Nevertheless, a normal monsoon outlook and water reservoir level
better than -year average will be positives for the farming sector.
Macroeconomic tailwinds mostly remain intact for the rural
economy, and with likely higher Government support, particularly
with states going for elections, this bodes well for tractor demand. STRATEGY

Digital Learning Initiatives
From F22 onwards, our focus has been to bring world class
digital learning content to our employees across all
management grades. To that effect, we entered into
strategic partnerships with key content partners such as
Udemy, HMM Spark etc. Furthermore, in order to make the
learning experience truly world class, we have also
launched the EdCast by Cornerstone, learning experience
platform for employees across a number of our Group
companies.
Our learning experience platform now consolidates our
various digital learning content providers under a single
umbrella for the learner and by leveraging the power of
artificial intelligence and machine learning, it is able to
provide highly personalised learning content to our
employees across the Group. Furthermore, we have been
able to leverage the platform well beyond standardised elearnings and this has led to both a high adoption rate as
well as learner NPS. In a short period of time, we have seen
approximately % adoption rate and more than million
items of learning consumed. We believe this is a testament
to our skills first approach of capability development and
we anticipate further demand for learning content over
FY24. RE-IMAGINING THE NASHIK CAMPUS
Our Nashik MLU campus is a world class facility built around the
modern learner. With multiple Mahindra plants and offices located in
a km radius of this facility, the campus is generally a beehive of
activity! It is detached from the hustle bustle of the city life and is
surrounded by more than trees, flora and fauna. Yet, because of
our digital first approach to learning, our learners are always
connected to the best learning resources always. On an average, the campus hosts more than , learners each
year. Furthermore, the Nashik campus has world class classroom
facilities and has the ability to host more than learners
simultaneously. While COVID- significantly restricted our use of
the campus, in F22, we also prepared the Nashik campus to welcome
back our learners to our piece of heaven.
Apart from the ongoing maintenance activities, we have now reimagined the entire classroom experience such that it creates a
seamless blended learning experience. Our digital classroom
connects with learners who are sitting in Nashik, Chennai, Mumbai
and/or at home such that the learning experience is not impacted.
This enables us to bring them world class faculty from within our
Group and outside at the touch of a button!
F23, saw a strong 'Back to Classroom' trend and MLU Nashik has
once again regained its prominence as the crown jewel of our
learning infrastructure. We hosted more than , learners over
the course of the year with an average score of . in terms of an incampus experience. FUNCTIONAL TALENT ACCELERATORS
AT MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA
In the Mahindra Group, Talent Management is crucial and critical,
both from a business point of view and from a talent perspective.
Technical talent accelerators are equally important to build a
pipeline of business leaders. The aforesaid initiative has helped to create global sustained
competitiveness and the Technical Ladder that was conceptualised
in MRV is a unique way of differentiating technical talent from
general management in terms of performance management, talent
management and capability building. It puts a high focus on
developing deep technical expertise in various systems of product
development.
The Technical Ladder implementation in Mahindra has been a
response to one of the biggest challenges that the Company has
been facing in Talent Management. The first step of technical ladder
was achieved by creating unique competencies, which combined
technical skills and leadership behaviours. These were deployed in
performance management discussions and capability building
initiatives. Specific development goals are now integrated into
training needs and Learning & Growth Plan (LGP) to facilitate
capability building of niche technical skills through right exposure,
and action learning projects.
The second step of technical ladder was to identify high potential
technical talent and develop them into future Technology Leaders
through a structured intervention. For the developmental journey,
we have tied-up with best-in-class organisations to support in Tech
Leap programme. As a result, today the Tech Ladder
framework is successfully
catering to more than ,
engineers, covering multiple COEs
and Project Functions across the
Automotive and Farm Divisions. PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Our performance management system is built on strong principles of
simplicity, accountability, empowerment, and meritocracy. It aligns
the individual efforts and energy with organisational priorities. It
creates a strong merit-based culture that rewards and encourages
outperformance. Leaders and managers are held accountable for
fostering an environment which encourages employees to
demonstrate the right behaviours and deliver outstanding results. In our quest to build a healthy
pipeline of technical talent in
Product Development and the
related associated areas, the
Company set up the Mahindra
Research Valley (MRV), which
serves as a crucible for innovation
and technology for the Auto and
Farm Divisions of the Company. The performance cycle is from 1st April to 31st March with a threestep process of Goal Setting, Mid-Year Review and Annual Appraisal.
Feedback/development conversations between people managers
and direct reports is key at every stage. A key highlight of our
performance system is that we no longer use overall appraisal
ratings. All key decisions (e.g., Promotions, Increments, Rewards, etc.)
are based on the individual's Goal Sheet / Performance Score and
Scores on Leadership Behaviours and discussions amongst the
talent panels appropriately constituted at different levels. Learning
& Growth Plan is a key tool in our performance management system
which aims at developing skills for current and future roles, and for
career growth for employees. The overall objective of the performance management system is to
ensure an alignment between an individual's goals and the
organisation's goals and priorities, thereby enabling conversations at
every step of the process and actions towards enhancing
accountability and providing a base for a focussed career growth.
Lastly, this simple and transparent system aims not just to evaluate
and reward performance but also reinforces and drives the three key
Mahindra Leadership Behaviours of Collaboration, Agility and Bold in turn driving the right culture across. During the year, we have driven leadership perspective sharing
sessions, conscious inclusion workshops, infrastructure correction
across our locations and established ERGs across prominent
locations. We have announced, e-accessibility on our social media
platforms the International Day of People with Disabilities, where all
our posts on social media carry image descriptions and closed
captions. We expect these steps to help us build more inclusive
culture going forward. GROUP MANAGEMENT CADRE (GMC)
The next step of our strategic management process is the Group
Management Cadre programme to attract leadership talent at the
entry-level from top B-Schools of the country. This programme
continues to strengthen Mahindra's position as an 'Employer of
Choice' across premier B-School campuses and creates a strong
talent pool to drive Mahindra's future growth. Through this
programme, GMCs joined the Group in , and GMCs will join
us in across various Sectors and functions. As part of the
Experiential Module, each GMC that joins us undergoes three stints
of months across different functions and businesses. The Summer
Internship Programme has evolved over the years as a critical source
of the GMC talent pool, and this year we have students who have
joined us from the top B-school of India under the GMC Summer
Internship Programme . Our special focus has been to improve gender diversity in areas of
technology and business operations which are also going to be thrust
areas for the Company. Equal Opportunity Policy GROUP DIVERSITY COUNCIL (GDC)
Diversity and Inclusion
The Group continues its strong focus on fostering Diversity and
Inclusion (D&I) at the workplace with the D&I Vision of - M&M provides equal opportunity to all persons. There is no unfair

to Rise for a more equal world. We strive to
build a caring, fair and thriving culture
where individuals can bring their whole
selves to work and leverage their fullest
potential to create products and
experiences that count for our customers.” We have been working with wider involvement across the

inclusive workplace. As a culmination of this exercise, a new D&I
Charter was rolled out with clearly articulated vision and beliefs. Focussed Hiring

initiatives towards the same that are worth mentioning here are: Creating a culture and ecosystem of self-managed
teams

- Naya dristikon' for cell members and union leaders The industrial relations scenario continued to be largely positive
across all the manufacturing locations. Long Term Wage and Bonus
settlements were closed amicably for all the plants. The sustained
efforts towards building a transformational work culture resulted in
zero production loss in the F23 and helped create a C O L L A B O R AT I V E | H E A LT H Y |
PRODUCTIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT Proactive and employee-centric
shop ﬂoor practices, a focus on
transparent communication of
business goals, an effective
concern resolution mechanism,
and a ﬁrm belief that employees
are the most valuable assets of
the Company, are the cornerstone
of our Company's employee
relations approach. An 'open door policy' with constant dialogue to create win-win
situations, have helped our Company build trust and harmony. MAHINDRA SKILL EXCELLENCE
The Mahindra Skill Excellence is an internal platform that aims at
holistic skill enhancement programme for the shop floor associates.
Over the years, it has matured and in the current year, ,
associates have participated from across all its manufacturing units. A HEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENT

Commodity price risk or Foreign Exchange Risk &
hedging activities The Commodity prices in the Financial Year - were
volatile. In the first quarter steel prices rose sharply due
to supply concerns caused by Russia-Ukraine conflict.
However, from June onwards, prices softened on
account of easing supply concerns and weak economic
outlook due to interest rate increases by major Central
Banks. Additionally, there was pressure on Indian steel
prices due to levy of export duties on key raw materials
and products. Subsequently, from December, ,
onwards, prices firmed up due to expectations of demand
growth driven by withdrawal of zero-Covid policy by
Chinese Government and removal of export duties by
Indian Government. Your Company stayed focused on
cost reduction through measures like VA/VE, negotiation
with suppliers, long term price contracting, etc. Your Company continues to watch the market situation
closely and continues to focus on mitigating commodity
price volatility through “Commodity Risk Management”.

governed in accordance with the Foreign Exchange Risk
Management Policy and Commodity Risk Management
Policy, approved by the Board of Directors of your

(E-Waste), lead batteries etc. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - •	Organic Waste can be diverted to biological treatment through which the waste is reused. Another method is the
thermal treatment (incineration) with the generation of power.
•	Hazardous waste such as paint sludge, oily cotton waste can be diverted to coprocessing operation, which can be
reused as a resource (fuel) for cement industries. It can be also recycled as raw material.
•	Food waste generated at manufacturing plants are moved to the biogas plant for biogas generation. All the nonhazardous waste, which is generated inside the plant like metal, non-metal parts are being recycled.
•	Implementing “Zero Waste to Landfill” program resulted in not only environmental benefit but also in business benefit.

Integrated Annual Report - Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited
 Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (the “Company”) which comprise the standalone balance sheet as
at March , and the standalone statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), standalone statement of changes in equity
and standalone statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the
information required by the Companies Act, (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March , and its profit and other comprehensive loss, changes
in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section () of the Act. Our responsibilities under those
SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of
the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that
are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements. Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of
the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Impairment assessment of certain long-term investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Company has long-term investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures
and associates (collectively “the investments”) aggregating Rs. ,
crores as at March . The Company records the investments
at cost less any provision for impairment loss. Changes in business
environment, including market or economic environment, geopolitical
situation and general inflationary trend could have a significant impact
on the valuation of certain investments. Investments where an indication
based on these factors exist, are tested for impairment at the end of
the reporting period. Our audit procedures included: The Company determines the recoverable value of such investments
and compares it to its carrying amount to determine impairment loss.
The recoverable value is determined basis following key assumptions:
• projected future cash inflows; • expected growth rate; discount rate; terminal growth rate; • comparison of price and market multiples The recoverable amount, which is the higher of the market value or Value
In Use (VIU) or fair value less cost of disposal of such investments, is
estimated and the impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement
of profit and loss and carrying amount of investments is reduced to its
recoverable amount.
See Note (d)(iv) to the Standalone financial statements. •	Assessed the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of
key controls in respect of the Company’s impairment assessment
process, including the approval of forecasts and valuation models;
•	Obtained an understanding of various external factors impacting the
recoverable value of the investment as at the end of the reporting
period;
•	Tested the key VIU assumptions used in estimating future cash flows
such as revenue volumes and prices, operating costs, inflation and
growth rates by comparing these inputs with externally derived data,
past performances, consistency with the Board approved investment
plans and knowledge of the industry;
•	Involved valuation specialists, as applicable, to evaluate the
assumptions including the discount rates used in VIU calculations;
•	Evaluated past performance where relevant, and assessed historical
accuracy of the forecast produced by management; and
•	Assessed the adequacy of disclosures on key judgements, assumptions
and quantitative data with respect to impairment losses. COMPANY

ACCOUNTS Impairment assessment of tangible assets and development expenditure capitalised and currently under development
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Company’s automotive and trucks and buses Cash Generating Units
(‘Auto CGU’) have aggregate tangible assets of Rs. , crores, which
includes property, plant and equipment of Rs. , crores and Rs. crores of capital-work-in-progress as at March . Further, the Auto
CGU has Rs. , crores of development expenditure capitalized, and
Rs. crores of intangible assets under development. Our audit procedures included: Changes in business environment, including market or economic
environment, geopolitical situation and general inflationary trend could
have a significant impact on the valuation of the tangible and intangible
assets of the Auto CGU. The tangible and intangible assets of the Auto CGU
are tested for impairment periodically. The Company assesses the carrying
amounts of the tangible and intangible assets to determine indicators of
impairment loss as the recoverable values rely on certain assumptions and
estimates of future performance which impact the valuation. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount which is the higher of VIU or fair
value less cost to sell of the Auto CGU, is estimated and the impairment
loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The carrying amount
of the tangible and intangible assets of Auto CGU is reduced to its
recoverable amount.
See Note (g) to the Standalone financial statements. •	Assessed the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of
key controls in respect of the Company’s impairment assessment

past performances, consistency with the Board approved investment
plans and knowledge of the industry;
•	Involved valuation specialists as applicable, to evaluate the
assumptions including the discount rates used in VIU calculations;
•	Evaluated past performance where relevant, and assessed historical
accuracy of the forecast produced by management;
•	Evaluated the stage of development of the intangible assets,
judgments used for expected probable economic benefits and
associated expenditures, and their assessment of feasibility of the
projects; and
•	Assessed the adequacy of disclosures on key judgements, assumptions

The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report thereon. The Company’s annual report
is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it
becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or
our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the Company’s annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the
matter to those charged with governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section () of the Act with respect to the
preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/ loss and other comprehensive
income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
We also:
•	Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances. Under Section ()(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has
adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made
by the Management and Board of Directors.
•	Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in
preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a
going concern.
•	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether
the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,
and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the
audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine
that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Integrated Annual Report - Annexure B to the Independent Auditors’ report on the standalone financial statements of
Mahindra & Mahindra Limited for the year ended March  Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid standalone financial statements under Clause (i) of
Sub-section of Section of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph (A)(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (“the Company”) as of March in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal
financial controls were operating effectively as at March , based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria
established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal
financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control
stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial
information, as required under the Act.
A
 uditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section () of the Act, to the extent
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that () pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
() provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations
of management and directors of the company; and () provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

ACCOUNTS CONSOLIDATED
ACCOUNTS Notes forming part of the Financial Statements | for the period ended 31st March, . General Information Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (‘the Company’) is a limited company incorporated in India. The addresses of its registered office and principal activities of
the Company are disclosed in the introduction to the Annual Report. The Ordinary (Equity) shares of the Company are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (“NSE”) and BSE Limited (“BSE”) in India. The
Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) of the Company are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are also admitted for trading on International
Order Book (IOB) of the London Stock Exchange.
. Significant Accounting Policies:
(a) Statement of compliance and basis of preparation and presentation These standalone or separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards as per the
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended and notified under Section of the Companies Act, (the ‘Act’) and other
relevant provisions of the Act. These standalone or separate financial statements were approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and authorised for issue on
26th May, .
(b) Basis of measurement The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments which are measured at
fair values.
(c) Measurement of fair values A number of Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and
liabilities. The Company has established policies and procedures with respect to the measurement of fair values. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: — —	Level : Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. — (d) Level : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level : Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses at the date of these financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the years presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in
which the estimate is revised and future periods affected. Key sources of estimation uncertainty at the date of financial statements, which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year, is in respect of useful lives of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, provision for product
warranties, fair value of financial assets/liabilities and impairment of investments. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year are discussed below: (i) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets The Company reviews the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation and amortisation expense in future periods. (ii) Provision for product warranties The Company recognises provision for warranties in respect of the products that it sells. Provisions are discounted, where necessary, to its
present value based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each balance
sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. (iii) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities and investments The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities on fair value basis at each balance sheet date or at the time they are assessed
for impairment. Fair value measurement that are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level ) requires estimates of operating margin,
discount rate, future growth rate, terminal values, etc. based on management’s best estimate about future developments. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - . Significant Accounting Policies: (contd.) (iv) Impairment of investments The Company assesses impairment of investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures which are recorded at cost. At the time when
there are any indications that such investments have suffered a loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss. The recoverable
amount requires estimates of operating margin, discount rate, future growth rate, terminal values, etc. based on management’s best estimate.
(e) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment,
if any. Cost includes financing cost relating to borrowed funds attributable to the construction or acquisition of qualifying tangible assets upto the date
the assets are ready for use. Depreciation is provided on straight-line basis for property, plant and equipment so as to expense the depreciable amount, i.e. the cost less
estimated residual value, over its estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and the effect of any
changes in estimate is accounted for on a prospective basis. When an asset is scrapped or otherwise disposed off, the cost and related depreciation are removed from the books of account and resultant profit
or loss, if any, is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The management’s estimate of useful lives are in accordance with Schedule II to the Companies Act, , other than the following asset classes,
based on the Company’s expected usage pattern supported by technical assessment: (f) Asset Class Useful lives (i) Certain items of Plant and Equipment - years as the case may be. (ii) Buildings (Roads) years (iii) Vehicles years Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortised on a straight line basis so as to reflect the pattern in which the asset’s economic benefits
are consumed. Intangible assets under development The Company expenses costs incurred during research phase to profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred. Development phase expenses
are initially recognised as intangible assets under development until the development phase is complete, upon which the amount is capitalised as
intangible asset. Intangible assets i) Technical Knowhow The expenditure incurred is amortised over the estimated period of benefit, commencing with the year of purchase of the technology. ii) Development Expenditure The expenditure incurred on technical services and other project/product related expenses are amortised over the estimated period of benefit,
not exceeding months. iii) Brand license fee The expenditure incurred is amortised over the period of relevant licence fee or the estimated period of benefit, whichever is lower. Software Expenditure iv) The expenditure incurred is amortised over three financial years equally commencing from the year in which the expenditure is incurred. v) Others
The expenditure incurred is amortised over the estimated period of benefit. The amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed annually and changes in expected useful lives are treated
as changes in estimates. COMPANY

ACCOUNTS CONSOLIDATED
ACCOUNTS Significant Accounting Policies: (contd.)
(g) Impairment of assets At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant & equipment, intangible assets and investments
in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the value in use or fair value less cost to sell, of the asset or cash-generating
unit, as the case may be, is estimated and impairment loss (if any) is recognised and the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. In
assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been
adjusted. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate
of its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) earlier. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
(h) Inventories Inventories comprise all costs of purchase, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Raw materials and bought out components are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on the basis of the weighted
average method. Finished goods produced, stock in trade, manufactured components and work-in-progress are carried at cost or net realisable value whichever
is lower. Stores, spares and tools other than obsolete and slow moving items are carried at cost. Obsolete and slow moving items are valued at cost or
estimated net realisable value, whichever is lower.
(i) Foreign exchange transactions and translation Transactions in foreign currencies i.e. other than the Company’s functional currency of Indian Rupees are recognised at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated
at the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value is determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms
of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period
in which they arise except for exchange differences on transactions entered into in order to hedge certain foreign currency risks (refer policy on
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting).
(j)	Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (k) The Company accounts for its equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment, if any.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition
or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are
added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs
directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately
in profit or loss. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. Classification and subsequent measurement Financial assets All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or
sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention
in the marketplace. All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value depending on their
respective classification. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - . Significant Accounting Policies: (contd.) On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as - measured at: — Amortised cost; or — Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) - debt investment; or — Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) - equity investment; or — Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period the Company changes its business model
for managing financial assets. All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets
unless designated as effective hedge instruments which are accounted as per hedge accounting requirements discussed below. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced
by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment expenses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain and
loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees paid or received
that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the
debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. Debt investment at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income under effective interest method, foreign exchange gains
and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). On
derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. For equity investments other than investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, the Company makes an election on an
instrument-by-instrument basis to designate equity investments as measured at FVTOCI. These elected investments are measured at fair
value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the reserves.
The cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the investments. These equity investments are not held for
trading. Dividend income received on such equity investments are recognised in profit or loss. Equity investments that are not designated to be measured at Cost or FVTOCI are designated to be measured at FVTPL. Subsequent changes
in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Financial liabilities and equity instruments Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity
instruments issued by the Company is recognised at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as
held-for-trading or it is a derivative (that does not meet hedge accounting requirements) or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Other
financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains
and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the
rights to receive the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Company neither
transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises
its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for the amount it may have to pay. If the Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, but retains either all or substantially all
of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognised and the proceeds received are recognised as a
collateralised borrowing. COMPANY

ACCOUNTS Significant Accounting Policies: (contd.) Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Company currently
has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously. Financial guarantee contracts A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because
a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently
measured at the higher of: • the amount of loss allowance determined in accordance with impairment requirements of Ind AS ; and •	the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of
Ind AS . Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps, to manage its
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are not financial assets within the
scope of Ind AS are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts
and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the
end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective
as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the
nature of the hedged item. The Company designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges or
cash flow hedges. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and
on an ongoing basis, the Company documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows
of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated under hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the
profit or loss. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (relating to effective portion as described above) are
reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge
accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss
accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Impairment of financial assets The Company applies the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for recognising impairment loss on financial assets. With respect to trade receivables
and loans, the Company measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at
FVTOCI, the loss allowance is recognised in OCI and is not reduced from the carrying amount of the financial asset in the balance sheet. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This
is generally the case when the Company determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash
flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities under
the Company’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - . Significant Accounting Policies: (contd.)
(l) Revenue Recognition
Sale of goods or services The Company recognises revenue from sale of goods or services at the amount of transaction price (excluding variable consideration that is
constrained), that is allocated to the performance obligation satisfied. Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company
expects it to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. An
amount of consideration can vary because of discounts, rebates, incentives etc. which are explicitly stated in the contract or are as per customary
business practices. The consideration can also vary where the entitlement is contingent on occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event. The
Company includes variable consideration as part of transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the
amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
Variable consideration is estimated using the expected value method or the most likely amount depending on which method the Company expects
to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled and is applied consistently throughout the contract. Payment terms agreed with a customer are as per business practice and the financing component, if significant, is separated from the transaction
price and accounted as interest income. Dividend and interest income Dividend from investments are recognised in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established. Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of
income can be measured reliably.
(m) Government Grants The Company, directly or indirectly through a consortium of Mahindra Group Companies, is entitled to various incentives from government authorities
in respect of manufacturing units located in developing regions. The Company accounts for its entitlement as income on accrual basis. Government grants that are revenue in nature, are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company
recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. The benefit of a government loan at a below market-rate of interest is treated as government grant and is measured as the difference between
proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates.
(n) Employee Benefits
Superannuation Fund, ESIC and Labour Welfare Fund The Company’s contribution paid / payable during the year to Superannuation Fund, ESIC and Labour Welfare Fund are recognised in profit or loss. Provident Fund Contributions to Provident Fund are made to a Trust administered by the Company/Regional Provident Fund Commissioners and are charged to
profit or loss as incurred. The Company is liable for the contribution and any shortfall in interest between the amount of income realised by the
investments and the interest payable to members at the rate declared by the Government of India in respect of the Trust administered by the
Company. The shortfall and remeasurement thereof, if any, based on actuarial valuation is recognised through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). Long term Compensated Absences Company’s liability towards long term compensated absences are determined by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. Gratuity, post retirement medical benefit and post retirement housing allowance schemes Company’s liability towards gratuity, post retirement medical benefit and post retirement housing allowance schemes are determined by independent
actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. Past services are recognised at the earlier of the plan amendment/curtailment and the recognition
of related restructuring costs/termination benefits. The obligation on long term compensated absences and defined benefit plans are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows
using a discount rate that is determined by reference to the market yields at the balance sheet date on government bonds where the currency
and terms of the government bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated terms of the obligation. COMPANY

ACCOUNTS CONSOLIDATED
ACCOUNTS Significant Accounting Policies: (contd.) Remeasurement gains/losses Remeasurement of defined benefit plans, comprising of actuarial gains or losses, return on plan assets excluding interest income are recognised
immediately in balance sheet with corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or
loss in subsequent period. Remeasurement gains or losses on long term compensated absences that are classified as other long term benefits are recognised in profit or loss. Share based payments Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the
Company’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity.
(o) Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets
are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their
expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit
or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
(p) Income taxes Current tax Current tax is determined as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income for the year. The Company’s current tax is calculated using
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying values of assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the
manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets including that on unused tax losses and unused tax credits are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences could be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for the temporary differences arising from the initial recognition (other than in a business
combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Current and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the
business combination.
(q) Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Company
will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is
the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount
is the present value of these cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material). Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations are recognised at the time of sale of the relevant products, at the best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the Company’s obligation. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - . Significant Accounting Policies: (contd.)
(r) Business Combination Business Combination under common control are accounted under “the pooling of interest method” i.e. in accordance with Appendix C in Ind AS Business combinations, at carrying amount of assets and liabilities acquired and any excess of consideration issued over the net assets acquired is
recognised as capital reserve on common control business combination.
(s) Leases The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS and this may require significant judgment.
The Company also uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend or
terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain based on relevant facts and circumstances that the option to extend or terminate will be
exercised. If there is a change in facts and circumstances, the expected lease term is revised accordingly. The discount rate is generally based on the interest rate specific to the lease being evaluated or if that cannot be easily determined the incremental
borrowing rate for similar term is used. The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company as a lessee The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus
any initial direct costs incurred and restoration cost, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. In
addition, the right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments. When a lease liability is remeasured,
the corresponding adjustment of the lease liability is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the
carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
(t) Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use. To classify as held for sale, the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, its sale must
be highly probable and is marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The Group must also be committed to
the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. Non-current assets
and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
. Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
 inistry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)
M
Rules as issued from time to time. On March , , MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, by issuing the Companies
(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, , applicable from April 1st, , as below:
)	
Ind AS – Presentation of Financial Statements: The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than
their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information included in an entity’s financial statements, is
material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Company does
not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.
)	Ind AS – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: The amendments will help entities to distinguish between
accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting
estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement
uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves
measurement uncertainty. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.
)	Ind AS – Income Taxes: The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning
obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs and of Ind AS (recognition exemption) so
that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Company
does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements. COMPANY

Employee Benefits
General description of defined benefit plans:
Gratuity The Company operates a gratuity plan covering qualifying employees. The benefit payable is the greater of the amount calculated as per the Payment
of Gratuity Act or the Company scheme applicable to the employee. The benefit vests upon completion of five years of continuous service and once
vested it is payable to employees on retirement or on termination of employment. In case of death while in service, the gratuity is payable irrespective
of vesting. The Company makes annual contribution to the group gratuity scheme administered by the Life Insurance Corporation of India through its
Gratuity Trust Fund.
Post - retirement medical The Company provides post retirement medical cover to select grade of employees to cover the retiring employee and their spouse upto a specified
age through mediclaim policy on which the premiums are paid by the Company. The eligibility of the employee for the benefit as well as the amount of
medical cover purchased is determined by the grade of the employee at the time of retirement.
Post - retirement housing allowance The Company operates a post retirement benefit scheme for a certain grade of employees in which a monthly allowance determined on the basis of the
last drawn basic salary at the time of retirement, is paid to the retiring employee in lieu of housing.
Though its defined benefit plans the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset Volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with references to government bond yields; if plan assets under perform compared to this
yield, this will create or increase a deficit. The defined benefit plans may hold equity type assets, which may carry volatility and associated risk.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in government bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this is expected to be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’
investment in debt instruments.
Inflation risk The present value of some of the defined benefit plan obligations are calculated with reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such,
an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. The post retirement medical benefit obligation is sensitive to medical
inflation and accordingly, an increase in medical inflation rate would increase the plan’s liability.
Life expectancy The present value of defined benefit plan obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants, both during and
after the employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.

— Credit Risk Management Credit Risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company. The Company
has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating
the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Company’s exposure are continuously monitored. (a) Financial Guarantees 
In addition, the Company is exposed to credit risk in relation to financial guarantees given to banks. The Company’s maximum exposure in
this respect is the maximum amount, the Company would have to pay, if the guarantee is called on. Financial guarantees are accounted as
explained in note (k). The amount recognised in Balance Sheet as liabilities and maximum exposure details are as given below:

lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. The Company has computed expected credit losses based on a provision matrix
which uses historical credit loss experience of the Company. Forward-looking information (including macroeconomic information) has been
incorporated into the determination of expected credit losses. The Company has taken dealer deposits, bank guarantees etc. which are
considered as collateral and these are considered in determination of expected credit losses, where applicable. Amounts pertaining to these collaterals are as given below:Rupees crores

Integrated Annual Report - Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited
 Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries
(Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), its associates and its joint ventures, which comprise the consolidated balance
sheet as at March , and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes
in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of reports of the other
auditors on separate/consolidated financial statements of such subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures as were audited by the other auditors, the
aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true
and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, its associates and
joint ventures as at March , of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive loss, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows
for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section () of the Act. Our responsibilities under those
SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent
of the Group, its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial
statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the
consideration of reports of the other auditors referred to in paragraph (a) of the “Other Matters” section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate/
consolidated financial statements of components audited by them, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the
current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matters
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Impairment assessment of tangible assets and development expenditure
capitalised and currently under development Our audit procedures included: The Group’s Automotive Cash Generating Units (‘Auto CGU’) have
aggregate tangible assets of Rs , crores, which includes property,
plant and equipment of Rs , crores and capital-work-in-progress
of Rs crores as at March . Further, the Auto CGU has
development expenditure capitalized of Rs , crores, and intangible
assets under development of Rs , crores.
Changes in business environment, including market or economic environment,
geopolitical situation and general inflationary trend could have a significant
impact on the valuation of the tangible and intangible assets of the Auto
CGU. The tangible and intangible assets of the Auto CGU are tested for
impairment periodically. The Group assesses the carrying amounts of the
tangible and intangible assets to determine indicators of impairment loss as
the recoverable values rely on certain assumptions and estimates of future
performance which impact the valuation. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount which is the higher of VIU or fair value less cost to
sell of the Auto CGU, is estimated and the impairment loss is recognised in
the statement of profit and loss. The carrying amount of the tangible and
intangible assets of Auto CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
See Note (h) to consolidated financial statements •	Assessed the design, implementation and operating effectiveness
of key controls in respect of the Group’s impairment assessment
process, including the approval of forecasts and valuation models;
•	Tested the key VIU assumptions used in estimating future cash
flows such as revenue volumes and prices, operating costs, inflation
and growth rates by comparing these inputs with externally derived
data, past performances, consistency with the Board approved
investment plans and knowledge of the industry;
•	Involved valuation specialists as applicable, to evaluate the
assumptions including the discount rates used in VIU calculations;
•	Evaluated past performance where relevant, and assessed historical
accuracy of the forecast produced by management;
•	Evaluated the stage of development of the intangible assets,
judgments used for expected probable economic benefits and
associated expenditures, and their assessment of feasibility of the
projects; and
•	Assessed the adequacy of disclosures on key judgements,
assumptions and quantitative data with respect to impairment
losses. COMPANY

constituting approximately % of the financial service’s
business total assets. Significant judgement is used in classifying
these loan assets and applying appropriate measurement
principles. ECL on such loan assets measured at amortised cost
is a critical estimate involving greater level of management
judgement. As part of the component auditor’s risk assessment,
they determined that the ECL on such loan assets has a high
degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of
reasonable outcomes. The elements of estimating ECL which
involved increased level of audit focus are the following: Examined the policies approved by the Board of Directors of the component that
articulate the objectives of managing each portfolio and their business models. The
component auditor have also verified the methodology adopted for computation
of ECL (“ECL Model”) that addresses policies approved by the Board of Directors
of the component, procedures and controls for assessing and measuring credit
risk on all lending exposures measured at amortised cost. Additionally, the
component auditor have confirmed that adjustments to the output of the ECL
Model is consistent with the documented rationale and basis for such adjustments
and that the amount of adjustment has been approved by the Audit Committee
of the Board of Directors of the component. The audit procedures related to the
allowance for ECL included the following, among others:
• a.	completeness and accuracy of the EAD and the classification thereof
into stages consistent with the definitions applied in accordance with
the policy approved by the Board of Directors of the component
including the appropriateness of the qualitative factors to be applied; •	Qualitative and quantitative factors used in staging the
loan assets measured at amortised cost;
•	Basis used for estimating Probabilities of Default (“PD”),
Loss Given Default (“LGD”) and Exposure at Default (“EAD”)
at product level with past trends; b.	completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of information used in
the estimation of the PD and LGD for the different stages depending
on the nature of the portfolio; and •	Judgements used in projecting economic scenarios and
probability weights applied to reflect future economic
conditions; and
•	Adjustments to model driven ECL results to address
emerging trends. Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the following: c.	accuracy of the computation of the ECL estimate including
reasonableness of the methodology used to determine macroeconomic overlays and adjustments to the output of the ECL Model.
• Test of details on a sample in respect of the following:
a.	accuracy and completeness of the input data such as period of default
and other related information used in estimating the PD;
b.	the mathematical accuracy of the ECL computation by using the same
input data as used by the component;
c.	completeness and accuracy of the staging of the loans and the
underlying data based on which the ECL estimates have been
computed; and
d.	evaluating the adequacy of the adjustment made to the output as per
the ECL Model to ensure that the adjustment was in conformity with
the amount approved by the Audit Committee of the component. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - Other Information
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the Holding Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report thereon. The
Holding Company’s annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it
becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the Holding Company’s annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate
the matter to those charged with governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements
in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated profit/loss and other comprehensive
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its associates and joint ventures in accordance
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section of the Act.
The respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each company and for preventing
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements
that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation
of the consolidated financial statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its
associates and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company
or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for overseeing the
financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under
Section ()(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management
and Board of Directors. COMPANY

ACCOUNTS •	Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated
financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group
and its associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements of such entities or business activities within the Group and its associates
and joint ventures to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the
other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for
the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in
this regard are further described in paragraph (a) of the section titled “Other Matters” in this audit report.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of
which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and
to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

ACCOUNTS Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the consolidated financial statements
of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited for the year ended March  Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under Clause (i) of
Sub‑section of Section of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph (A)(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) as
of and for the year ended March , we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company and
such companies incorporated in India under the Act which are its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and joint ventures, as of that date.
In our opinion and based on the consideration of reports of the other auditors on internal financial controls with reference to financial statements
of subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint ventures, as were audited by the other auditors, the Holding Company and such companies
incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and joint ventures, have, in all material respects, adequate internal
financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at March , based on
the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by such companies considering the essential components of
such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on
the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the respective company considering the essential components
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and
the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section () of the Act, to the extent applicable to an
audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the relevant subsidiary companies, associate
companies and joint ventures in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that () pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ()
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of
management and directors of the company; and () provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section ()(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements insofar as it relates to subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in
India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.
The internal financial controls with reference to financial statements insofar as it relates to associate companies and joint ventures, which are
companies incorporated in India and included in these consolidated financial statements, have not been audited either by us or by other auditors. In our
opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us by the Management, such unaudited associate companies and joint ventures are
not material to the Holding Company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Integrated Annual Report - Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements | for the year ended 31st March, General information Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (‘the Company’) is a limited company incorporated in India. The address of its registered office and principal activities of the
Company are disclosed in the introduction to the Annual Report. The Ordinary (Equity) shares of the Company are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (“NSE”) and BSE Limited (“BSE”) in India. The
Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) of the Company are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and also admitted for trading on International Order
Book (IOB) of London Stock Exchange. Significant Accounting Policies
a) Statement of compliance and basis of preparation and presentation These consolidated financial statements of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’ or ‘Mahindra Group’) have been prepared
in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended and notified under
Section of the Companies Act, (the ‘Act’) and other relevant provisions of the Act. b) These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 26th May, .
Basis of measurement The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured
at fair values.
c) Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. Subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis from the date the control is
transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for
business combinations by the Group. Changes in the Group’s interest in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted as equity transactions. The carrying amount
of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any
difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is
recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company. In case of loss of control of a subsidiary, the difference of the aggregate of fair value of consideration received and fair value of retained
interest as compared to the carrying amount of the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary and related noncontrolling interest, if any, is recognised as gain or loss in Consolidated statement of profit and loss. Additionally, components of Other
Comprehensive Income of Subsidiaries are reclassified to Consolidated statement of profit and loss or transferred directly to retained earnings.
The fair value of any investment retained at the date when control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial recognition of investment in an associate
or jointly controlled entity or as the fair value on initial recognition of investment classified as a financial asset. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. These financial statements are prepared by applying
uniform accounting policies in use at the Group. Associates Associates are the entities over which the Group has significant influence. Investment in associates are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting, after initially being recognised at cost. Joint arrangements A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have the rights to the net assets of the
arrangement. The results, assets and liabilities of a joint venture are accounted using the equity method of accounting. Where the Group’s activities
are conducted through joint operations (i.e. the parties have rights to the assets and obligation for liabilities relating to the arrangement), the Group
recognises its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses of such joint operations incurred jointly along with its share of income from the sale
of output.
d) Measurement of fair values A number of Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and
liabilities. The Group has established policies and procedures with respect to the measurement of fair values. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: — Level : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. — Level : Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. — Level : Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

ACCOUNTS CONSOLIDATED
ACCOUNTS Significant Accounting Policies (contd.)
e) Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses at the date of these financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the years presented. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in
which the estimate is revised and future periods affected. Key sources of estimation uncertainty at the date of financial statements, which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year, is in respect of useful lives of property, plant and equipment, other intangible assets, provision
for product warranties, fair value of financial assets /liabilities and impairment of investments and goodwill. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year are discussed below:
i) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets The Group reviews the useful lifes of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation and amortisation expense in future periods.
ii) Provision for product warranties The Group recognises provision for warranties in respect of the products that it sells. Provisions are discounted, where necessary, to its present
value based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date
and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
iii) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities and investments The Group measures certain financial assets and liabilities on fair value basis at each balance sheet date or at the time they are assessed
for impairment. Fair value measurement that are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level ) requires estimates of operating margin,
discount rate, future growth rate, terminal values, etc. based on management’s best estimate about future developments.
iv) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets including goodwill The Group estimates the value in use of the cash generating unit (CGU) based on the future cash flows after considering current economic
conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The
estimated cash flows are developed using internal forecasts. The discount rate used for the CGUs represent the weighted average cost of
capital based on historical market returns of comparable companies. v) Impairment of financial services receivable The measurement of impairment losses on loan assets and commitments, requires judgement, in estimating the amount and timing of future
cash flows and recoverability of collateral values while determining the impairment losses and assessing a significant increase in credit risk. The financial services business Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation is the output of a complex model with a number of underlying
assumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL model that are considered in accounting
judgements and estimates include: —	The financial services business criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk —	The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis —	Development of ECL model, including the various formulae and the choice of inputs —	Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weights, to derive the economic inputs into the ECL model —	Management overlay used in circumstances where management judges that the existing inputs, assumptions and model techniques do
not capture all the risk factors relevant to the lending portfolios. f) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, if any. Cost includes financing cost relating to borrowed funds attributable to the construction or acquisition of qualifying tangible assets upto the date
the assets are ready for use. Depreciation is provided on straight-line basis for property, plant and equipment so as to expense the depreciable amount, i.e. the cost less
estimated residual value, over its estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and the effect of any
changes in estimate is accounted for on a prospective basis. When an asset is scrapped or otherwise disposed off, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the books of account and
resultant profit or loss, if any, is reflected in profit or loss. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - . Significant Accounting Policies (contd.) The management’s estimate of useful lives are in accordance with Schedule II to the Companies Act, , other than the following asset classes,
based on the Group’s expected usage pattern supported by technical assessment: g) Asset Class Useful lives (i) Plant and equipment - years (ii) Buildings, including roads - years (iii) Vehicles - years Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is initially recognised as the excess of consideration paid and acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable net assets of
acquired business. Subsequent to initial measurement, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment, if any. Goodwill is allocated to
the cash-generating unit which is expected to benefit from the business combination. Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost except those acquired in a business combination. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortised on a straight line basis so as to reflect the pattern in
which the asset’s economic benefits are consumed. Intangible assets under development The Group expenses costs incurred during research phase to profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred. Development phase expenses
are initially recognised as intangible assets under development until the development phase is complete, upon which the amount is capitalised as
intangible asset. Intangible assets acquired under business combination Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value on the
acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. Other intangible assets Technical Knowhow The expenditure incurred is amortised over the estimated period of benefit, commencing with the year of purchase of the technology. Development Expenditure The expenditure incurred on technical services and other project/product related expenses are amortised over the estimated period of benefit, not
exceeding months. Brand license fee The expenditure incurred is amortised over the period of relevant licence fee or the estimated period of benefit, whichever is lower.
Software Expenditure The expenditure incurred is amortised over months commencing from the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Others The expenditure incurred is amortised over the estimated period of benefit. The amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed annually and changes in expected useful lives are treated as
changes in estimates.
h) Impairment of Assets At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the
value in use or fair value less cost to sell, of the asset or cash-generating unit, as the case may be, is estimated and impairment loss (if any) is
recognised and the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate
of its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) earlier. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. COMPANY

i) Inventories Inventories comprise cost of purchase, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Raw materials and bought out components are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on the basis of the weighted
average method. Finished goods produced, stock in trade, manufactured components and work-in-progress are carried at cost or net realisable value whichever
is lower. Stores, spares and tools other than obsolete and slow moving items are carried at cost. Obsolete and slow moving items are valued at cost or
estimated net realisable value, whichever is lower.
j) Foreign exchange transactions and translation The functional currency of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is Indian Rupees whereas the functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting
period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are measured at the rates prevailing at the date when the
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange
differences on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for exchange differences on transactions
entered into in order to hedge certain foreign currency risks (refer policy on Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting). For the purposes of presenting these consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated
into Indian Rupees using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (and attributed
to non-controlling interests as appropriate). On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of control over
a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an associate that includes a foreign
operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation
attributable to the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss. In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that does not result in the Group losing control over
the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in
profit or loss. For all other partial disposal (i.e. partial disposals of associates or joint arrangements that do not result in the Group losing significant
influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.
k) Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue
of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or
deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable
to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss. A trade
receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.
Classification and subsequent measurement Financial assets All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are
purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value depending on their respective classification. On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at - — Amortised cost; or — Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) - debt investment; or — Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) - equity investment; or — Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) The classification of debt instrument as amortised cost or FVTOCI is based on the business model and cash flow characteristics of such instrument. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if the Group changes its business model for managing financial
assets. All financial asset not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets unless
designated as effective hedge instruments which are accounted as per hedge accounting requirements discussed below. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - . Significant Accounting Policies (contd.) Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced
by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain and loss on
derecognition is recognised in profit or loss. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees paid or received that form an
integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument,
or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. Debt investment at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income under effective interest method, foreign exchange gains
and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses
accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. For equity investments, the Group makes an election on an instrument-by-instrument basis to designate equity investments as measured at FVTOCI.
These elected investments are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the reserves. The cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the investments. These equity
investments are not held for trading. Dividend income received on such equity investments are recognised in profit or loss. Equity investments that are not designated as measured at Cost or FVTOCI are designated as measured at FVTPL and subsequent changes in fair
value are recognised in profit or loss. Financial liabilities and equity instruments Debt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity
instruments issued by the Group is recognised at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-fortrading or it is a derivative (that does not meet hedge accounting requirements) or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Other financial
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses
are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss. Compound instruments An issued financial instrument that comprises of both the liability and equity components are accounted as compound financial instruments. The
fair value of the liability component is separated from the compound instrument and the residual value is recognised as equity component of other
financial instrument. The liability component is subsequently measured at amortised cost, whereas the equity component is not remeasured after
initial recognition. The transaction costs related to compound instruments are allocated to the liability and equity components in the proportion
to the allocation of gross proceeds. Transaction costs related to equity component is recognised directly in equity and the cost related to liability
component is included in the carrying amount of the liability component and amortised using effective interest method.
Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights
to receive the contractual cash flows from financial asset in a manner that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are
transferred to another party. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to
control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for the amount it may have to pay. If the Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, but retains either all or substantially all of
the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognised and the proceeds received are recognised as a
collateralised borrowing.
Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Group currently has
a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously. Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because
a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments issued by the Group are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at
FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of: • the amount of loss allowance determined in accordance with impairment requirements of Ind AS ; and •	the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of
Ind AS . COMPANY

AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT STANDALONE
ACCOUNTS CONSOLIDATED
ACCOUNTS Significant Accounting Policies (contd.)
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure
to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are not financial assets within the scope of
Ind AS are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and economic characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts
and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the
end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective
as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the
nature of the hedged item. The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges or cash
flow hedges. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with
its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an
ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated under hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the
consolidated statement of profit and loss. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (relating to effective portion as described above) are
reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge
accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the profit or loss.
Impairment of financial assets The Group applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for recognising impairment loss on financial assets. With respect to trade receivables, the
Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises
lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial
instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount
equal to month ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be recognised is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of
a default occurring since initial recognition. month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on
a financial instrument that are possible within months after the reporting date. Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at
FVTOCI, the loss allowance is recognised in OCI. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery.
This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash
flows to repay the amounts subject to the write- off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities
under the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.
l) Revenue Recognition
Sale of Goods or Services The Group recognises revenue from sale of goods or services at the amount of transaction price (excluding variable consideration that is
constrained), that is allocated to the performance obligation satisfied. Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group
expects it to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. An
amount of consideration can vary because of discounts, rebates, incentives etc. which are explicitly stated in the contract or are as per customary
business practices. The consideration can also vary where the entitlement is contingent on occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event.
The Group includes variable consideration as part of transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in
the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently
resolved. Variable consideration is estimated using the expected value method or the most likely amount depending on which method the
Group expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled and is applied consistently throughout the contract.
Payment terms agreed with a customer are as per business practice and the financing component, if significant, is separated from the transaction
price and accounted as interest income. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - . Significant Accounting Policies (contd.) Dividend and interest income Dividend from investments are recognised in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established. Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income
can be measured reliably.
Income from financing business Interest income is recognised in Consolidated Statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method for all financial instruments measured
at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVTOCI and debt instruments designated at FVTPL. If expectations regarding the cash flows on the financial asset are revised for reasons other than credit risk, the adjustment is recorded as a positive
or negative adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset in the balance sheet with an increase or reduction in interest income. The adjustment
is subsequently amortised through interest income in the Consolidated Statement of profit and loss. When a financial asset becomes credit-impaired, the Group calculates interest income by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised
cost of the financial asset. If the financial assets cures and is no longer credit-impaired, the Group reverts to calculating interest income on a
gross basis. Additional interest and interest on trade advances, are recognised when they become measurable and when it is not unreasonable to expect their
ultimate collection. Income from bill discounting is recognised over the tenure of the instrument so as to provide a constant periodic rate of return. Fee and commission income Fee based income are recognised when they become measurable and when it is probable to expect their ultimate collection. Commission and brokerage income earned for the services rendered are recognised as and when they are due. Long term construction contracts and property development activity Some of the Group companies are in the business to develop and sell residential and commercial properties. Revenue from such contracts is
recognised when control over the property has been transferred to the customer. An enforceable right to payment does not arise until the
development of the property is completed. Therefore, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the legal title has passed to the customer and
the development of the property is completed. The revenue is measured at the transaction price agreed under the contract. For certain contracts involving the sale of property under development, deferred payment schemes are offered to the customers. The transaction
price is adjusted for the effects of the significant financing component. Income from Sale of land and other rights Revenue from sale of land and other rights are considered upon transfer of all significant risks and rewards of ownership of such real estate/
property as per the terms of the contract entered into with the buyers, which are generally with the firmity of the sale contracts/agreements. Income from Project Management Project management fees receivable on fixed period contracts is accounted over the tenure of the contract/agreement. Where the fee is linked to
the input costs, revenue is recognised as a proportion of the work completed based on progress claims submitted. Where the management fee is
linked to the revenue generation from the project, revenue is recognised on the percentage of completion basis. Land Lease Premium Land lease premium is recognised as income upon creation of leasehold rights in favour of the lessee or upon an agreement to create leasehold
rights with handing over of possession. Property lease rentals, income from operation & maintenance charges and water charges are recognised on
an accrual basis as per terms of the agreement with the lessees. Vacation ownership Under the vacation ownership, holiday facilities are provided to members for a specified period each year, over a number of years, for which
membership fee is collected either in full upfront, or on a deferred payment basis. Revenue from sale of vacation ownership weeks is recognised when related right to use the specific property over the specific week(s) is transferred
to the buyer for a consideration. Income from sale of vacation ownership weeks in villas is recognised when the outcome of a villa project can be estimated reliably. Project revenue
and contract costs associated with the contract are recognised as revenue and expenses respectively by reference to the percentage of completion
of the project activity at the reporting date. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense in profit or loss in
the period in which such probability occurs. COMPANY

ACCOUNTS Significant Accounting Policies (contd.) Revenue from Membership fees Revenue from membership fees are recognised over the tenure of membership as the performance obligation is fulfilled. The revenue which will be
recognised in future periods are disclosed under Contract Liability. Non refundable admission fee is recognised as income on admission of a member. Entitlement fee, which entitles the members the vacation ownership facilities over the agreed membership period, are recognised as income equally
over the tenure of membership, commencing from the year of admission and disclosed under Contract Liability. Revenue from Annual subscription fees Annual subscription fee dues from members are recognised as income on accrual basis and fees pertaining to the period beyond the year end is
disclosed under Contract Liability. Interest income on deferred payment plans In case of deferred payment plans wherein significant financing components exists in a contract, interest income or expense is recognised over the
financing period using the Effective Interest Method.
m) Government Grants The Group, directly or indirectly through a consortium of group companies, is entitled to various incentives from government authorities in respect of
manufacturing units located in developing regions. The Group accounts for its entitlement as income on accrual basis. Government grants that are revenue in nature, are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognises
as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. The benefit of a government loan at a below market-rate of interest is treated as government grant and is measured as the difference between
proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates at the inception of the loan.
n) Employee Benefits
Superannuation Fund, ESIC and Labour Welfare Fund The Group’s contribution paid /payable during the year to Superannuation Fund, ESIC and Labour Welfare Fund are recognised in profit or loss. Provident Fund Contributions to Provident Fund are made to Trusts administered by the Group/Regional Provident Fund Commissioners and are charged to profit
or loss as incurred. The Group is liable for the contribution and any shortfall in interest between the amount of interest realised by the investments
and the interest payable to members at the rate declared by the Government of India in respect of the Trust administered by the Group companies. Long term Compensated Absences The liability towards long term compensated absences are determined by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Gratuity, post retirement medical benefit and post retirement housing allowance schemes The liability towards gratuity, post retirement medical benefit and post retirement housing allowance schemes are determined by independent
actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. Past services are recognised at the earlier of the plan amendment/curtailment and the recognition
of related restructuring costs /termination benefits. The obligation on long term compensated absences and other defined benefit plan are measured at the present value of estimated future cash
flows using a discount rate that is determined by reference to the market yields at the balance sheet date on government bonds (high quality
corporate bonds in case of foreign companies) where the currency and terms of the government bonds are consistent with the currency and
estimated terms of the defined benefit obligation. Remeasurement gains/losses Remeasurement of defined benefit plans, comprising of actuarial gains or losses, return on plan assets excluding interest income are recognised
immediately in balance sheet with corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or
loss in subsequent period. Remeasurement gains or losses on long term compensated absences that are classified as other long term benefits are recognised in profit or loss. Share based payments Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the
Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. Share appreciation rights which are cash settled share-based payments are recognised as employee benefit expense over the relevant service
period. The liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - . Significant Accounting Policies (contd.)
o) Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets
are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their
expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit
or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
p) Income taxes Current tax Current tax is determined as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income for the year. The Group’s current tax is calculated using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying values of assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the
manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets including that on unused tax losses and unused tax credits are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences could be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for: —	the temporary differences arising from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction
that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit, —	the temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, —	Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws that is not likely to give future economic benefits in the form of adjustment
to future income tax liability, and —	temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Current and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the
business combination.
q) Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group
will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision
is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks
and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying
amount is the present value of these cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material). Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations are recognised at the time of sale of the relevant products, at the best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligation. Contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are initially measured at fair value at the acquisition date. At the end of the subsequent
reporting periods, such contingent liabilities are measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognised in accordance with Ind AS Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent Liabilities and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance
with Ind AS - Revenue from contracts with customers.
r) Leases At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the
right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: ­	­—	the contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically distinct or
represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the lessor has a substantive substitution right, then the asset
is not identified ­	­—	the Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and COMPANY

ACCOUNTS Significant Accounting Policies (contd.) ­	­—	the Group as a lessee has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Group has this right when it has the decision-making rights that
are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. In rare cases where the decision about how and for what
purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset if either: o the Group as a lessee has the right to operate the asset; or o the Group as a lessee designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used The Group as a lessee The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost,
which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any
initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site
on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the
useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if
any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date,
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, using the incremental borrowing rate. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s
estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise
a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is
recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of months or less
and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
The Group as lessor When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.
Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance
lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a
finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight- line basis over the lease term as part of ‘other
income’
s) Business combinations The Group accounts for its business combinations under acquisition method of accounting. The acquiree’s identifiable assets including liabilities
and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the sum
of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held
equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
is recognised as goodwill. Before recognising capital reserve in respect thereof, the Group determines whether there exists clear evidence of underlying reasons for classifying
the business combination as a bargain purchase. Thereafter, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and
all of the liabilities assumed and recognises any additional asset or liabilities that are identified in that reassessment. The Group then reviews the
procedures used to measure the amounts that Ind AS requires for the purposes of calculating the bargain purchase. If the gain remains after this
reassessment and review, the Group recognises it directly in equity as capital reserve. Non-controlling interest is initially measured at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of
measurement basis is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis. Subsequent to initial acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interest
is the amount of those interest in initial recognition plus the non-controlling interest’s share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries. When the consideration transferred by the Group in business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting in a contingent consideration
arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as a part of the consideration transferred in
a business combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments, are adjusted
retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill or capital reserve as the case may be. When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to its acquisition-date
fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition
date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where such treatment would be
appropriate if that interest were disposed off. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - . Significant Accounting Policies (contd.) If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group
reports provisional amount for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amount are adjusted during the measurement
period (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amount recognised at that date. In consolidated financial statements, acquisition of non-controlling interest is accounted as equity transaction. The carrying amount of the Group’s
interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between
the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in
equity and attributed to owners of the Company. Business Combination under common control are accounted as per Appendix C in Ind AS - Business combinations, at carrying amount of assets
and liabilities acquired and any excess of consideration issued over the net assets acquired is recognised as capital reserve on common control
business combination.
t) Acquisition of interest in associate and joint ventures Acquisition of interest in an associate or a joint venture, is initially recognised at cost. Any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s
share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is regarded as goodwill, which is included in the carrying amount of
the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, after
reassessment, is recognised in equity as capital reserve in the period in which the investment is acquired.
u) Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use. To classify as held for sale, the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, its sale must be highly probable and is marketed
for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The Group must also be committed to the sale, which should be expected
to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. v) Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Hyperinflationary economies During the year, the Turkish economy has been designated as hyperinflationary. Accordingly, financial statements of entities whose functional
currency is Turkish Lira have been prepared applying IND AS ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’. This primarily includes (i)
restatement of non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost in the balance sheet and all items of income and expenses in the
statement of profit and loss, using the general price index at the balance sheet date, and (ii) recording gain or loss on net monetary position.
. Recent accounting pronouncements Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)
Rules as issued from time to time. On 31st March, , MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, by issuing the
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, , applicable from 1st April, , as below:
a) Ind AS - Presentation of Financial Statements The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy
information, together with other information included in an entity’s financial statements, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence
decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in
its financial statements.
b) Ind AS - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting
estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in
financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in
financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any
significant impact in its financial statements.
c) Ind AS - Income Taxes The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments
narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs and of Ind AS (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to
transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Group does not expect this amendment
to have any significant impact in its financial statements. . ,. ,. . ,. ,. ,. . — (.) (.) . . . . — (.) (.) . ,. ,. ,. . . (,.) (.) . ,. ,. ,. . (.) (.) (.) ,. ,. . . . . . (.) (.) . . . . . (.) (.)

Total............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... ,. ,. The Group tests goodwill on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the CGU to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired.
The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of the CGU or group of CGUs that benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which
represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount is determined based on higher
of value‐in‐use and fair value less cost of disposal. Where there is no basis for making a reliable estimate of the price at which an orderly transaction
to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions, the recoverable amount
is determined by value-in-use. In determining the value-in-use, cash flow projections approved by appropriate level of management are considered. In
circumstances where a reliable value-in-use estimate is difficult to make whereas market value of the asset or the CGU or group of CGUs is readily
available, the latter is used for the determination of recoverable amount with appropriate adjustments, where applicable. Apart from the observable market information, significant management estimates and judgments are used to determine the recoverable amounts based
on value-in-use. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of recoverable amount includes estimated growth rates (including
terminal growth rates), margins and discount rates. Cash flow projections are usually considered for next - years and represent management’s best
estimate about future developments with due consideration for past performance. Cash flows beyond the five‐year period are extrapolated using
terminal growth rates. In certain cases, the performance of the cash generating units were below their expected levels. Accordingly, the Group assessed such cash generating
units for the recoverable amounts based on fair value less cost of disposal and value-in-use estimates. The goodwill impairment had been recognised as
‘Exceptional item’ in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and is attributable to the following operating segments:
(a) ‘Farm Equipment’ segment - Rs. . crores (: Nil). This relates to goodwill allocated to an international subsidiary.
(b) ‘Financial services’ segment - Rs. . crores (: Nil). This relates to goodwill allocated to an international subsidiary. . COMPANY

amount of the asset to determine the amount of the impairment loss. During the year ended 31st March, , the internal and external sources of
information on the economic environment in which these entities operate, provided indicators of asset impairment for certain international subsidiaries.
Consequently, impairment has been recognised for property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, capital work-in-progress, intangible assets

Integrated Annual Report - . Employee Benefits
General description of defined benefit plans
Gratuity Some of the group entities operate a gratuity plan covering qualifying employees. The benefit payable is the greater of the amount calculated as per the
Payment of Gratuity Act or the Company scheme applicable to the employee. The benefit vests upon completion of five years of continuous service and once
vested it is payable to employees on retirement or on termination of employment. In case of death while in service, the gratuity is payable irrespective of
vesting. Some entities makes annual contribution to the group gratuity scheme administered by the Life Insurance Corporation of India through its Gratuity
Trust Fund.
Post retirement medical Few entities in the Group provide post retirement medical cover to select grade of employees to cover the retiring employee and their spouse upto a
specified age through mediclaim policy on which the premiums are paid. The eligibility of the employee for the benefit as well as the amount of medical
cover purchased is determined by the grade of the employee at the time of retirement.
Post retirement housing allowance The Company operates a post retirement benefit scheme for a certain grade of employees in which a monthly allowance determined on the basis of the
last drawn basic salary at the time of retirement, is paid to the retiring employee in lieu of housing.
Risk exposure
Through its defined benefit plans the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with references to government bond yields; if plan assets underperform compared to this yield,
this will create or increase a deficit. The defined benefit plans may hold equity type assets, which may carry volatility and associated risk.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in government bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this is expected to be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s
investment in debt instruments.
Inflation risk The present value of some of the defined benefit plan obligations are calculated with reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an
increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. The post retirement medical benefit obligation is sensitive to medical inflation
and accordingly, an increase in medical inflation rate would increase the plan’s liability.
Life expectancy The present value of defined benefit plan obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants, both during and
after the employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. COMPANY

(b) Credit Risk Management (contd.) 
Inputs considered in the ECL model 
In assessing the impairment of loans assets under Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Model, the loan assets have been segmented into three stages. The
three stages reflect the general pattern of credit deterioration of a financial instrument. The differences in accounting between stages, relate to
the recognition of expected credit losses and the calculation and presentation of interest revenue. The financial services business categorises loan assets into stages based on the days past due status: — Stage : - days past due — Stage : - days past due — Stage : More than days RBI COVID- Resolution Framework During the year ended 31st March, and year ended 31st March, , the financial services business had implemented resolution plans in
order to provide relief to borrowers adversely impacted due to onslaught of multiple waves /variants of COVID- Pandemic under the resolution
framework . vide circular no. RBI/-/ DOR.No.BP.BC//../- dated 6th August, for personal loan customers and
resolution framework . vide circular No. RBI/-/ DOR.STR.REC./../- dated 5th May, . The loan modifications
executed under both these schemes have not been classified as renegotiated as they are as a result of market-wide customer relief programme
and not borrower-specific. The financial services business continues to monitor the recoverability of loans granted in accordance with these circulars
and is continue to carry adequate provisioning based on the repayment behaviour on these loan accounts. Since the COVID- pandemic has been
brought under control through development of vaccines, announcement of various health improvement and relief measures by respective Govt.
authorities, and economies have returned to normalcy, the Group had witnessed significant improvement in business/financial performance over the
period during second half of previous year as well as current year. Impact of COVID- The outbreak of COVID- led to nationwide lockdown from March , which gradually phased out over the next few months basis the local level
spread of the pandemic. The nation was impacted by the second wave of the pandemic in the first half of the fiscal year which again slowed
down the economic activities to a limited extent. Despite the successful roll out of vaccines around the world, a varying degree of uncertainty
remained through out the year ended 31st March, . This was caused by new variants of COVID-, varying vaccine effectiveness and the need
for reimposing of government - imposed restrictions. This uncertainty is reflected in the financial services business assessment of impairment
loss allowance on its loans which are subject to a number of management judgements and estimates. In relation to COVID-, judgements and
assumptions include the extent and duration of the pandemic, the changes in the macro economic outlook and its associated impact on the
impairment calculations. Assumptions considered in the ECL model The financial services business has made the following assumptions in the ECL Model: – “Loss given default” (LGD) is common for all three Stages and is based on loss in past portfolio. Actual cash flows are discounted at loan EIR
rate for arriving loss rate. – “Probability of Default” (PD) is applied on Stage and Stage on portfolio basis and for Stage PD at %. This is calculated as an average
of the last months yearly movement of default rates and future adjustment for macro economic factor. Estimation Technique The financial services business has applied the following estimation technique in its ECL model: “Probability of Default” (PD) is applied on Stage and Stage on portfolio basis and for Stage PD at %. This is calculated as an average of
the last months yearly movement of default rates and future adjustment for macro economic factor such as agriculture and change in GDP are
considered most relevant in determining the PD. The Group assigns probability to these factors in order to determine the impact of such factors
on PD. –	Loss given default is calculated based on discounted actual cash flow on past portfolio in default along with reversals. The methodologies and assumptions applied in the impairment loss allowance calculations have primarily remained unchanged from those
applied while preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, . The financial services business has been updating the
ECL model with the latest set of data on reasonable periodic intervals for the year ended 31st March, , to capture the significant changes
in economic and market drivers and changes in risk profile of customer credit exposures. Output of ECL model refresh is also factored in
computation of provisions. Forward Looking Information In calculating the expected credit loss rates, the financial services business considers historical loss rates on portfolio over a period which
covers most external factors like drought, government and policy changes etc and these historical PDs are converted into forward looking
PDs considering the agricultural and GDP growth estimates. MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LTD.
Integrated Annual Report - . Financial Instruments (contd.)
(b) Credit Risk Management (contd.)
Assessment of significant increase in credit risk When determining whether the risk of default has increased significantly since initial recognition, the financial services business considers both
quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the business’s historical experience, including forward-looking information. The
financial services business considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost and effort. The
financial services business’s accounting policy is not to use the practical expedient that the financial assets with ‘low’ credit risk at the reporting
date are deemed not to have had a significant increase in credit risk. As a result the financial services business monitors all financial assets and
loan commitments that are subject to impairment for significant increase in credit risk. Definition of default The financial services business considers a financial asset to be in “default” and therefore Stage (credit impaired) for ECL calculations when the
borrower becomes days past due on its contractual payments except for personal loans, where the Group has an early recognition norm of
classification in to stage on the basis of overdue more than days past due. Policy for write off of Loan Assets The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when there is no realistic prospect of further recovery. This is generally the case when
the financial services business determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to
repay the amounts subject to the write- off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities under the
recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment loss The expected credit loss allowance provision is determined as follows:
